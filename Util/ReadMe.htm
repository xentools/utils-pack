1. DESCRIPTION
</H3>
<P>
The BDV Notepad is a more intuitive text editor than the standard issued Windows Notepad. By using the BVD Notepad you will be able to have more functions, easy-to-use and easy to understand interface. All of these functions for a grand price of zero! How lucky you are to use this programme for that big price!

2. INSTALL/UNINSTALL
</H3>
<P>
<B>INSTALL:</B>
The BDV Notepad does not require any installations whatsoever, and it could be run as is, simply by double-clicking on its icon. You may copy the &quot;Notepad.exe&quot; file that came with your download, to the original Windows folder on your hard drive, and replace the standard Notepad that is installed with the your Windows operating system. For your convenience, we recommend that you also copy the language, and the codepage files as well.
<BR>
<I><B>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</B>
Should you decide to replace the standard Windows Notepad, we strongly recommend that you make a back-up copy of the original Windows Notepad first! Furthermore, the BVD Notepad will use the Windows registry only if you decide to use the &quot;Associations&quot; option thereof.
</I>
</P>
<B>UNINSTALL:</B> 
You may simply delete the BVD Notepad from your computer should you decide not to use it any longer.
<BR>
<I><B>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</B>
If you did use the &quot;Associations&quot; option, and wished to delete the BVD Notepad from your computer, you must first un-check all checked items on the &quot;Associations&quot; tab where you had checked previously. Then the defualts of the &quot;Associations&quot; shall be re-stored automatically upon your next re-boot of your computer. Furthermore, it is necessary that the &quot;Notepad.ini&quot; file be deleted as well in order to have the full default values get en-abled automatically by your operating system.

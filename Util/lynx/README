Lynx Browser 2.8.5rel.1
WWW text browser



I have edited the lynx.cfg file to make this a stable, fast and versatile but always secure text browser - the standard config file is included, though, in the main installation directory as lynx.cfg.dist

For some reson it is not possible to pre-configure the JUMPFILE instruction to work on every system - you may want to edit it yourself, following the example in lynx.cfg. For creating your own jumpfile, edit jumps.htm, following the example.

If you see strange characters on the screen, you also may want to edit the option CHARACTER_SET in lynx.cfg: for some reason cp850 to me seems the most versatile!

Another customizable feature is the Lynx Style Sheet (*.lss), which is called for in the lynx.bat. You can change the *.lss file to any one in the lynx directory, or make your own, personal style sheet, following the examples.


Have fun, and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

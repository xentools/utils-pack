HTML Editor 1.6 (Beta Started April 2001)

Thank you for using the Editor that I have created.

This program is freeware and use it at your own risk. Having said that I believe this program to be relatively free from bugs, but however I do miss them so please report them (I cant fix them if I don't know about them).

The Editor uses a component bought from Dream called DCMemo that has all the syntax highlighting capabilities, check http://www.dream-com.com for more details. The editor is written in Delphi 4, the source code is available on request to my email address below. The Editor also uses components from the Raise list pack http://www.raise.com/.

-------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------

There is a problem with the changing of the syntax parsers on the fly, this is out of my hands, should hopefully be fixed in the next release. It might sometimes cause the editor to crash if you have the highlight urls checked and a document open. If it does crash you'll have to end task on the editor.


-------------------------------------------------
POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS FOR THE FUTURE
-------------------------------------------------

Might Include support to capture the output of the compile java file procedure.
Add other shapes to the imagemap palette (e.g. circle, polygon).
Maybe allow re-editing of the image maps.
Customise the toolbar (so you can select which buttons you want).

Any suggestions?, please email then to html-ed@lz1.co.uk (they are all greatly received)


-------------------------------------------------
OTHER SOFTWARE AT www.lz1.co.uk
-------------------------------------------------

Another piece of software I have written is GetFonts. Which can read all the fonts including postscript on your system and enable you to collect up the fonts and copy them to a particular folder. This program is designed to read Quark Xpress report files for the fonts used inside the documents and collect up the necessery fonts.

There is also a mailing mailer that I have written as well as unit for delphi that has several unit that any delphi programmer needs. All should be available from my web site if not email me.


-------------------------------------------------
WHERE THE SETTINGS ARE NOW SAVED
-------------------------------------------------

This version of the editor uses the registry to save all the settings, under key

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\HTML Editor

To return the editor to its default settings, simply remove the entire key and load the program again. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING!! (as messing with the registry can be fatal to your system).

Please note this key is not removed if the editor is uninstalled.

<a name="Introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>TED Notepad is a growing freeware editor for true plain-text. It looks like a small Notepad, but is more and more fertile in innovative features, text-processing functions and other tools. All of them on hotkeys; all designed for quicker and advanced editing. The light-weight portable application fits on USB drive and loads instantly with no installation required. TED Notepad is designed especially for daily writing of notes, lists, scripts and html/php files.</p>
<p>Get ready for a simple text editor, yet full of new features and text tools - you will never learn them all. Don't type, ted it!</p>

<h3>Briefing</h3>
<p>Because TED Notepad supports only very basic formatting, you cannot accidentally save special formatting in documents, that need to remain pure-text. This is especially useful, when creating html/php Web pages, because no special characters/formatting may appear in a html/php Web page source code.</p>
<p>Quite extensive set of features covers entire MS Windows Notepad, Metapad or Win32Pad and includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enhanced searching and replacing; second search;</li>
<li>Plenty of hotkeys and some extra clipboards;</li>
<li>Several kinds of word and phrase completion;</li>
<li>All unicode characters and bi-directional support;</li>
<li>Unicode, UTF-8, Unix and Mac file types;</li>
<li>Text auto-indentation;</li>
<li>Extensive text statistics;</li>
<li>Recent and Favourites menu;</li>
<li>Relative and selective <i>Go to</i> jumping;</li>
<li>Options for auto-save, recovery and backup files;</li>
<li>Option to revert, when file is modified from outside;</li>
<li>and many, many other timesavers, options and settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Variety of text tools covers most of the text-based functions including:</p>

<ul>
<li>All types of case conversions;</li>
<li>Advanced text replacing and character translating;</li>
<li>Line indentation, unindentation, closing and tabifying;</li>
<li>Columns cutting and numbers adding;</li>
<li>HTML/XML Tags inserting;</li>
<li>Reversing of text, lines and words;</li>
<li>Full-scale line sorting;</li>
<li>Searching for line duplicates;</li>
<li>Word wrapping commiting and unwrapping;</li>
<li>File inclusion and exclusion;</li>
<li>and Filters Architecture for any user-defined plugins.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>TED Notepad was designed to replace the popular Windows Notepad in every way. Besides that, it has been covered by a variety of text tools, functions, features, clipboards and hotkeys. Optimized to the highest performance; while keeping the intuitive conservative user interface. It was developed and improved with the know-how I gained during all the studies. And as my personal hobby, it is completely free. If you want to show your support, please, consider a donation to this project or just tell your friends. The more people like it, the more motivation there is to improve.</p>
<p>The application was developed at the Labs of Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University in Prague; written in pure ANSI C language (no MFC, no C++, no Borland), using the system API functions, compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0. In contrast to other Notepad replacements, the development priority of TED Notepad was to create as stable and as fast as possible program. Without wizards, objects and toolbars; but with help and support of the other students there; I think it is now becoming what it ought to be.</p>

<h3>Future</h3>
<p>Although not versatile enough, the MS Windows Notepad was indeed my daily text editor since forever. That's how I have started this project. To extend its possibilities. Just a little bit. Well, by now, TED Notepad is far beyond every initial hope. But still, I am sure you can find a lot of good ideas about how to enhance the Notepad and cherish the fame of a monkey application. Tell me about them! It's all about communication, the rest is technology...</p>

<hr />

<a name="Installation"></a><h1>Installation</h1>
<p>There are several ways, how to get TED Notepad ready for use:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, you may use an Installer. It will install TED Notepad onto a computer, create some shortcuts in the start menu and optionally add some additional Filters. An installation as a default notepad replacement may be chosen, but also may turn out unsuccessful. See below.</li>
<li>Second, you may install TED Notepad from a ZIP package by yourself, without use and help of any wizards and/or automated dialogs. This is usually the most preferred way when installing as a portable application.</li>
<li>Third, you may run TED Notepad with no installation procedures at all. Just unpack from the ZIP package and run.</li>
</ul>

<p>All three types are described further below.</p>

<h3>Basic installation with the Installer</h3>
<p>Follow these steps to install TED Notepad using a NullSoft System Installer.</p>
<p>1. Download the Installer file of your choice and run it.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Note: Please, be careful to choose an appropriate installation file according to your system. You will have to choose between Windows 95/98/Me and Windows NT/2000/XP versions. The version for Windows NT/2000/XP will not run on Windows 95/98/Me. On the other hand, version for Windows Windows 95/98/Me is unable to fully support all Unicode characters.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>Note: You may also choose between <a href="#RichEdit_clone">LE</a> and <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE</a> clones. The <a href="#RichEdit_clone">LE</a> clone is the default one and is recommended. Please, see chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a> for more details about the available <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE</a> clone before installing.</dd>
</dl>

<p>2. Follow steps displayed by the Installer.</p>

<dl>
<dd>You will be able to choose, whether to install TED Notepad as a <i>notepad replacement</i> and as a <i>standalone application</i>. Additionally, you may choose to setup some basic Filters and External viewers as well. Finally, you may add a portable INI file to your installation.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>Installing as a <i>standalone application</i> will install TED Notepad into a specified directory, including the manual and all other files. This is the default installation type for a text editor.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>Installing as a <i>notepad replacement</i> will try to install TED Notepad as your default Notepad application. This may be considered as a violation by your System. Please, see <b>File protection troubles</b> below.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>The meaning and use of a <i>portable INI file</i> is described in chapter <a href="#Portable_INI_file">Portable INI file</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you come to a problem during the installation, read all notes above and below and also review the on-line manual for any further changes. You can find the most recent version of the on-line manual at <a href="http://jsimlo.sk/notepad/manual/">http://jsimlo.sk/notepad/manual/</a>.</p>
<p>If you find no answer to your problem, feel free to contact me directly through a form at <a href="http://jsimlo.sk/notepad/">http://jsimlo.sk/notepad/</a>. In such case, please, try to describe your problem as clearly as possible. Also note, that these pages are translated automatically by google. I do not understand German, Dutch or Portuguese... Really! I have already got several messages in Portuguese. I have not understood a single word.</p>
<p>Note, that this is a manual of TED Notepad version 5.2.1. If you are trying to install an older or newer version and have found no answer here, please refer to an appropriate manual version. You can find all reliable versions at <a href="http://jsimlo.sk/notepad/manual/">http://jsimlo.sk/notepad/manual/</a>.</p>

<h3>ZIP packages</h3>
<p>These zip packages, downloadable on the same page as the Installers, contain all the files you will need for a hand-held installation and/or for a direct, i.e. with no installation at all.</p>
<p>To run TED Notepad without any installation, just unzip the content of a package to a directory of your own choice and run the <span class="system">TedNPad.exe</span>. Keep the documentation file <span class="system">TedNPad.htm</span> in the same directory as the executable application. Otherwise the manual will not be accessible from the application.</p>
<p>To install TED Notpead, unzip the content of a chosen ZIP package into a desired directory. Then, it may be worthwile to add the chosen directory to the <span class="system">PATH</span> enviroment variable (e.g. by modifying the <span class="system">autoexec.bat</span> or System variables).</p>
<p>When installing as a default <i>notepad replacement</i> this way, the desired locations are <span class="system">%WINDIR%</span> and <span class="system">%SYSDIR%</span>. Usually these locations are directories like <span class="system">C:\WINDOWS</span>, <span class="system">C:\WINNT</span>, <span class="system">C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM</span>, <span class="system">C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32</span> and <span class="system">C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32</span>. It depends on the System type and version you use (ie. Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP).</p>

<table class="tnp_example">
<caption>To see what the desired locations may be, type this into the command prompt:</caption>
<tr>
<td>echo %WINDIR%
echo %SYSDIR%</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Windows 95/98/Me notes</h3>
<p>Please, be sure, you have downloaded a correct version, designed for Windows 95/98/Me. These older versions of windows may not be able to work with applications designed directly for Windows NT/2000/XP.</p>

<h3>Windows NT/2000/XP notes</h3>
<p>Please, be sure to have Administrator rights when installing TED Notepad into Program Files directory.
Without Administrator rights, you may only be able to run it directly with no installation.
See <b>ZIP packages</b> above.</p>
<p>The system may reject TED Notepad as a <i>notepad replacement</i>. See <b>File protection troubles</b> below.</p>

<h3>How to modify file associations?</h3>
<p>Find a file with an extension that you want to assign to TED Notepad. E.g. A <var>*.txt</var> file.</p>
<p>To modify the file associations, right-click on the file and choose <span class="system">Open with...</span> and then <span class="system">Choose program...</span> from the menu. A list of applications should appear. Select TED Notepad from the list. If TED Notepad is not listed there, click on <span class="system">Other...</span> button to add TED Notepad to the list manually. Finally, choose <span class="system">Always use this program...</span> and click the Ok button. The System should renew the file associations.</p>
<p>Note: This method is not available on some older versions of Windows. On these versions, you will have to try a second one described below.</p>
<p>Another method to modify the file association is to open Windows Explorer and click on the <span class="system">Folder Options</span> menu item, located within <span class="system">View</span> or <span class="system">Tools</span> menu. A dialog opens with a page named <span class="system">File types</span> where the file associations can be fully managed.</p>

<h3>File protection troubles</h3>
<p>On several versions of Windows (especially on Windows 2000/XP) you may come across the problem of a file protection while installing TED Notepad as a <i>notepad replacement</i>. Even after a successful installation, TED Notepad may be overwritten back by the original Windows Notepad. This is because your System is trying to <i>protect</i> you and your data by <i>protecting</i> its basic set of applications.</p>
<p>Whatever tricks could be done to bypass this file protection may be considered as a violation by your System. It will try to resist the tricks and restore the original Windows Notepad  application at all costs. Below come several descriptions of how to do such tricks, however this manual does not encourages you to do so. Proceed on your own risks.</p>

<h4>All occurences</h4>
<p>One such trick is to replace all occurrences of <span class="system">notepad.exe</span> on your computer at once quickly (I said quickly!). Be sure to handle all these locations: <span class="system">%WINDIR%</span>, <span class="system">%SYSDIR%</span> and and <span class="system">%SYSDIR%\dllcache</span>. You may need to write a script or a batch file to do so quickly enough. Windows will   then start complaining about an unrecognized version of a <span class="system">notepad.exe</span> and will ask for an installation CD. You can choose to ingore the warning and keep the unrecognized version.</p>
<p>Note, that if you use the Windows Installation CD/DVD in the future, TED Notepad may be (and probably will be) replaced back by the original Windows Notepad. Keep-up the fight or just give up.</p>

<h4>File protection list</h4>
<p>Another trick is to add notepad.exe to a list of unprotected files. In order to do that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run command prompt, i.e. click the Start menu -> Run and type <span class="system">cmd</span> there.</li>
<li>In the command prompt type <span class="system">cd %WINDIR%\system32\Restore</span> to change the directory.</li>
<li>Then type <span class="system">attrib -S -H -R filelist.xml</span> to clear hidden, system and read-only flags.</li>
<li>Then type <span class="system">notepad filelist.xml</span> to edit the file and add the highlighted lines into the <span class="system">Exclude</span> section:</li>
</ul>

<table class="tnp_example">

<tr>
<td>&lt;Exclude&gt;
    &lt;REC&gt;%windir%\system.ini&lt;/REC&gt;
    &lt;REC&gt;%windir%\tasks\desktop.ini&lt;/REC&gt;
    &lt;REC&gt;%windir%\win.ini&lt;/REC&gt;
<samp>    &lt;REC&gt;%windir%\notepad.exe&lt;/REC&gt;
    &lt;REC&gt;%windir%\system32\notepad.exe&lt;/REC&gt;</samp>
    &lt;REC&gt;*:\AUTOEXEC.BAT&lt;/REC&gt;
    &lt;REC&gt;*:\CONFIG.MSI&lt;/REC&gt;
    &lt;REC&gt;*:\CONFIG.SYS&lt;/REC&gt;
 &lt;/Exclude&gt;</td>
</tr></table>
<ul>
<li>Save the file and exit Notepad.</li>
<li>Back in the command prompt, type <span class="system">attrib +S +H +R filelist.xml</span> to restore the flags.</li>
<li>Install TED Notepad as a <i>notepad replacement</i>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Usage.2C_tips_and_tricks"></a><h1>Usage, tips and tricks</h1>
<p>These chapters describes how to use TED Notepad. They also suggests several advanced techniques available in TED Notepad that may rapidly enhance user's work with plain-text documents, lists, scripts, HTML or PHP source files.</p>
<p>Chapter <b><a href="#Managing_documents">Managing documents</a></b> describes the most simple basics about documents. Beside descriptions of creating, opening and saving documents it also describes how to use the <cite>Recent Files</cite> and <cite>Favourites menus</cite> to quicken access to specific documents. Furthermore, all supported file formats and types are discussed here. Advanced users will not find any useful information in this chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter <b><a href="#Searching_for_specific_text">Searching for specific text</a></b> describes all the techniques of how to efficiently search for a specific phrase and/or replace it by another. Several advanced methods and methods for searching for phrases with multiple lines are described here. May be worthy to read even for more advanced users.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<a name="Managing_documents"></a><h1>Managing documents</h1>
<h3>Opening and saving a document</h3>
<p>To open an existing document, click on an <cite>Open...</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>File</cite> (or use hotkey <cite>Ctrl+O</cite> instead of clicking) and choose a file from the dialog. Previous document will be closed and a new one will be loaded from the chosen file.</p>
<p>To save changes on a document to a file, click on a <cite>Save</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>File</cite> (or use hotkey <cite>Ctrl+S</cite>). The document will be saved back to a file from which it was previously opened. If the document was never opened (it was created as a new document), TED Notepad will ask for a new file name.</p>
<p>In order to save a document to a different file that it saw opened from, click on a <cite>Save As...</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>File</cite>. Choose a new file name in the dialog. The document will be saved into the new file and the old file will not be touched anymore.</p>
<p>There is also a possibility to reopen a file by clicking on a <cite>Revert</cite> menu item in the <cite>File</cite> menu. All unsaved changes will be discarded and the document will be reloaded from the file. Note, that the same results may be achieved by opening the same file through the <cite>Open...</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>File</cite>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, TED Notepad offers several other features to enhance and simplify access to your files. These features are:</p>

<ul>
<li><cite>Drag and Drop</cite>, which allows to open files by draging them from the Windows Explorer,</li>
<li><cite>Recent Files</cite> recollection, providing quick access to recently opened documents and</li>
<li><cite>Favourites</cite> menu, designed to bookmark documents that are used often.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, that TED Notepad allows to work with only one document at a time. In order to open several documents simultaneously, run TED Notepad several times and open each document in a different window.</p>

<h3>Drag &amp; Drop</h3>
<p>A file can also be opened by draging it from the Windows Explorer and dropping onto TED Notepad window. The document is loaded in the same way as if it was chosen in the <cite>Open</cite> dialog.</p>
<p>If multiple files are dropped, only the first one will be opened as described above. However, TED Notepad will ask, whether to load all other files too. If so, all files will be joinded into one document.</p>
<p>Note, that title of the document after such a join will remain equal to the document from the first file. The document itself will become modified as if the other files were typed in manually and when it is saved, all the text from all of the joined files will be written to the first file.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>Recent files</h3>
<p>Note, that files that were not opened successfuly are not collected here. Such unsuccessful opens may occur for example when opening a binary file described later.</p>

<h3>Favourites</h3>
<p>Use an <cite>Add File</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>Favourites</cite> to add the current document to this menu.</p>
<p>To access such document later, click on its file name in the <cite>Favourites</cite> menu. The document will be loaded from the file.</p>
<p>Finally, use a <cite>Manage List...</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>Favourites</cite> to open a dialog, where the documents from the <cite>Favourites</cite> menu can be managed, deleted and reordered.</p>

<h3>Revert</h3>
<p>In case you need to reload the current document (either because it was modified by someone else, or because you want to go back to its older version), you may try to revert the document, instead of closing and re-loading. The Revert feature (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+E</cite>) does not save the document in the process, thus allowing you to discard all unsaved changes. If content of the file has been changed from outside of TED Notepad in the meantime, a new version of the file will be loaded. The selection will try to persist the loading, placing the <q><a href="#Appendix">actual insertion point</a></q> to the same location. Also, the actual scrolling should persist unchanged.</p>

<h3>Binary files</h3>
<p>TED Notepad is a plain-text editor which handles only basic formatting functions. This characteristic ensures that you will not accidentally add any formatting to files that need to remain pure plain-text (e.g. source files of HTML web pages).</p>
<p>However, it also prevents you to open and edit formatted documents (e.g. Microsoft Word <var>*.doc</var> documents). That is because such formatted documents are usually saved to special <span class="system">binary</span> files. A <span class="system">binary</span> file is a file that contains special undisplayable control characters along with text. And when such a <span class="system">binary</span> file is opened in plain-text editors like TED Notepad, it is usually quite unreadable.</p>
<p>Also executable files (<var>*.exe</var>), movies (<var>*.avi</var>), music (<var>*.mp3</var>), etc. are saved to those <span class="system">binary</span> files, therefore, do not bother to open them in TED Notepad unless you know, what you are doing.</p>

<h3>File formats</h3>
<p>TED Notepad allows to open and save files in different file formats in order to help users to manage documents with different character sets in different languages. These file formats are <span class="system">ANSI</span>, <span class="system">UTF-8</span> and both <span class="system">Unicode</span> file formats. You can see the actual used file format in the <cite>Status bar</cite>.</p>
<p>To modify file format of a specific file, open such file in the TED Notepad. Then double-click on the <cite>Status bar</cite> in order to modify the format. When the desired format is set, save the document in order to update the file.</p>
<p>Note: The <span class="system">Unicode</span> file formats are much more complex than <span class="system">ANSI</span> file format is. Therefore, when using the <span class="system">UNICODE</span> versions of TED Notepad (i.e. the one intended for Win NT/2000/XP/Vista), it is possible to write special characters to the document, that the <span class="system">ANSI</span> file format does not support at all. In such cases, saving the document in the <span class="system">ANSI</span> file format would lead to substitution of those characters. Such substitution, however, is one way only and cannot be reverted later upon opening. Therefore a warning and a question is raised in such situation, whether to continue the saving.</p>
<p>Note, that these file formats does not affect the way a document is displayed on a screen or the way it is printed. They only affect the way the document is saved to a file.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> See the <a href="#File_page">File page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog, if you need to force saving and/or loading files without BOM.</p>

<h3>Unix/Mac files support</h3>
<p>Besides the file formats mentioned above, files can also differ in type of <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> they use. These <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> are special characters that are used to determine, where lines of a document break. Different systems use different characters to do so.</p>
<p>By default, these differences are automatically recogized by TED Notepad and Unix or Mac files are converted transparently upon any loading and/or saving. This behavior, however, may be modified through settings that are described later in chapter <a href="#File_page">File page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog.</p>
<p>To modify <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> in a specific file, open such file in the TED Notepad. Then double-click on the <cite>Status bar</cite> in order to toggle the format of the <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q>. When the desired format is set, save the document to update the file.</p>
<p>Note, that other editors may not be able to understand the Unix or Mac <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> and may load the document incorrectly. Even TED Notepad fails to do so, if the default behavior is turned off through the settings noted above.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended to keep your files with Windows <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> while working on Windows and convert it to Unix or Mac only if the file is to be ported to a respective system.</p>
<p>Note, that the format of <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> does not affect the way the document is displayed or printed. It affects only the way the document is saved to a file.</p>

<a name="Searching_for_specific_text"></a><h1>Searching for specific text</h1>
<h3>Basic searching</h3>
<p>The most basic and also the most conservative way of how to search for a specific text is through a <cite>Find</cite> dialog. In order to invoke it, click on a <cite>Find...</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>Search</cite>. Alternativelly, you may try a hotkey <cite>Ctrl+F</cite> to invoke the dialog faster and without using the mouse.</p>
<p>Note, that the document beneath the dialog is still accessible by the mouse. You can click in the document to change the actual caret position. The search is usually performed from this caret position, therefore, it may be useful to change it from time to time while subsequent searching.</p>
<p>Type a phrase into the edit box and click a <cite>Find Next</cite> button. The phrase will be searched for and then its occurrence selected, if found. Click the <cite>Find Next</cite> button until you find the location you have been searching for. Then, click on a <cite>Cancel</cite> button in the dialog, when done, to close the dialog.</p>
<p>When such a search is being performed, it is also saved for later use. To access this saved search, click a <cite>Find Next</cite> menu item from the <cite>Search</cite> menu (or use a simple <cite>F3</cite> hotkey) to search for the same phrase again. The search will be started from the actual caret position as if the <cite>Find</cite> dialog would have been invoked and the <cite>Find Next</cite> button clicked there.</p>

<h3>Direction of searching</h3>
<p>There is an option in the <cite>Find</cite> dialog described above considering the direction of search. Defaulty the search is performed <cite>downward</cite>, which means, that the phrase is being searched for behind the actual caret position, down to the end of the document. When this option is turned to <cite>upward</cite> direction, the phrase is being searched for before the caret position, up to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>Also a <cite>Find Previous</cite> menu item from the menu <cite>Search</cite>, that is similar to the <cite>Find Next</cite> menu item described above, is about the directions. The <cite>Find Previous</cite> (or its hotkey <cite>Ctrl+F3</cite>) does the same as the <cite>Find Next</cite> does, but in the reversed direction.</p>
<p>Note, that usually the <cite>Find Next</cite> searches after the caret and the <cite>Find Previous</cite> searches before the caret. However, if the direction in the <cite>Find</cite> dialog is chosen to be <cite>upward</cite>, then the meaning of directions of all search techniques is reversed.</p>
<p>Therefore, after chosing the <cite>upward</cite> direction in the <cite>Find</cite> dialog, the <cite>Find Next</cite> searches before the caret and the <cite>Find Previous</cite> searches after the caret. This may be a little confusing but it is usually the desired behavior anyway.</p>

<h3>Matching case and matching words</h3>
<p>Two more options from the <cite>Find</cite> dialog described above are options for <cite>matching case</cite> and <cite>matching whole words</cite>.</p>
<p>Defaultly, the search is performed without <cite>matching case</cite>, which means, that phrases like <var>John</var> and <var>JOHN</var> are considered to be the same. They actually are, but the second one is written all in capitals. If you somehow need to search for a specific phrase and it does matter whether the phrase is written in capitals or not, turn this option on.</p>
<p>The <cite>whole words</cite> choice is an option that turns a special check on, that is performed on every occurrence of the specified phrase. This check is about whether the occurrence is a rounded-off word. That means, that an occurrence of the phrase is really found only if there are no word letters directly adjacent to it. In other words and using an example, searching for phrase <var>john</var> will be successful in text like this: <var>hi john, how are you?</var>, but unsuccessfull in text like this: <var>hi johnny, how are you?</var></p>

<h3>Select to ...</h3>
<p>Searching for a phrase while keeping the actual selection is not a problem in TED Notepad. Use an advanced <cite>Select to Next</cite> and a <cite>Select to Previous</cite> menu items from the menu <cite>Search</cite> instead of the <cite>Find Next</cite> and the <cite>Find Previous</cite>. These special types of searching search for the specified phrase exactly the same way the <cite>Find Next</cite> and <cite>Find Previous</cite> do, but instead of selecting an occurrence, the selection is extended in order to cover the the found occurrence, not moved.</p>

<table class="tnp_example">
<caption>Example: (The inverted white text represents the selection.)</caption>
<tr>
<td>hi <samp>johnny,</samp> how are you?</td>
</tr></table>

<table class="tnp_example">
<caption>The <cite>Select to Next</cite> searching for phrase <var>are</var> will result in:</caption>
<tr>
<td>hi <samp>johnny, how are</samp> you?</td>
</tr></table>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>Advanced quick-searching</h3>
<p>A very common technique of how to search for exact phrases from the document is to select one such occurrence in the document, copy it to the clipboard invoke the <cite>Find</cite> dialog and then paste the clipboard into the dialog. Sure, its working but you have only one system clipboard available and working in the <cite>Find</cite> dialog, don't you?</p>
<p>A simple an easy way how to skip the copy and paste is to select the text and invoke the <cite>Find</cite> dialog while selected. TED Notepad will copy the selection into the dialog automatically.</p>
<p>Usually, a search is performed with default options, like the default downward direction, ignoring case and with no whole words matching. In these cases, an advanced user would just select some text, copy the selection into the dialog and immediatelly start the search for a next occurrence. Why bother with the dialog then? Only to enter the phrase?</p>
<p>For this very specific, but most frequently used technique, a special <cite>Find Selected</cite> menu item is present in the menu <cite>Search</cite>. Select a phrase, that you want to search for and click on the <cite>Find Selected</cite> menu item. Alternativelly, a hotkey <cite>Alt+F3</cite> may be used to quicken the technique to the most efficient level. The selection will be used as a phrase that is being searched for.</p>
<p>When you want to setup a search with <cite>Find Selected</cite>, but do not actually want to start searching immediately, use <cite>Find Later</cite> menu item (or simply hit <cite>Alt+Ctrl+F</cite>). <cite>Find Later</cite> defines a new search exactly as <cite>Find Selected</cite> does, but does run the actual search routine.</p>
<p>Note, that both <cite>Find Selected</cite> and <cite>Find Later</cite> are regular searches. Therefore, you may use all the <cite>Find Next</cite>, <cite>Find Previous</cite>, <cite>Select to Next</cite> and <cite>Select to Previous</cite> features to search for more occurrences at any later time.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Using the <cite>Find Later</cite> feature may help when you need to rewrite some specific phrase all over the document, but <cite>Replace All</cite> is not possible. You can start a search for the selected phrase with <cite>Find Later</cite>, then rewrite the selection before searching, and only then use the <cite>Find Next</cite> for more occurrences.</p>

<h3>Searching for multiple lines - why not?</h3>
<p>The only and usual reason, why a user may not search for a phrase that consists of several lines is very simple: the common <cite>Find</cite> dialog does not allow to enter more than one line at a time. As the phrase, that is being searched for must be written very specifically, there is usually no way to search for a text that is written on two successive lines.</p>
<p>However, according to the description of the <b>quick-searching</b> technique above, a user does not have to open the <cite>Find</cite> dialog to start a search at all. By the <cite>Find Selected</cite> feature, it is possible to select any text, even text that spreads over multiple lines and start a new search. Then, only those occurrences that spread over multiple lines will be found.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to search for a specific word, but only for those occurrences of the word, where the line breaks directly after the word. To do so, you must have at least one such occurrence of that word followed by a line break. If you do not have one or do not want to search for one manually, type the word and break the line. You may delete it later, right after starting the search. Then select the word and do not forget to select the line break too. Then use the <cite>Find Selected</cite> to start a new search.</p>
<p>Note: A line break can be selected exactly the same way as any other single character. Therefore, to select a line break that follows to the right from the selection, just hold down the <cite>Shift</cite> key and press the <cite>Right Arrow</cite> once to select one character to the right, which would be the line break.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> To delete the word you might have needed to type to start such a search, use the <cite>Undo</cite> feature.</p>

<h3>Replacing the occurrences</h3>
<p>To automatically replace occurrences found while searching, use a common <cite>Replace</cite> dialog. To invoke this dialog, click on a <cite>Replace...</cite> menu item in the menu <cite>Search</cite>.</p>
<p>The <cite>Replace</cite> dialog is quite similar to the <cite>Find</cite> dialog. Actually, the searching part is nearly the same. Enter a phrase to search for into the first edit box and a phrase to be used for replacing  occurrences to the second one.</p>
<p>Along with the <cite>Find Next</cite> and the <cite>Cancel</cite> buttons, there are two more: A <cite>Replace</cite> button and also a <cite>Replace All</cite> button. Also note, that the direction is missing. Replacing may not be done <cite>upwards</cite>.</p>
<p>Use the <cite>Find Next</cite> button the same way as in the <cite>Find</cite> dialog to find a location to be replaced and click on the <cite>Replace</cite> button. The actually selected occurrence will be replaced.</p>
<p>Note: If no occurrence is actually selected while clicking on the <cite>Replace</cite> button (i.e. no selection is made at all or the selection does not consist of an occurrence), next occurrence is automatically being found before replacing.</p>
<p>The <cite>Replace All</cite> button replaces all occurrences present in the document at once. The search always start at the beginning of the document, no matter where the caret is, and continues until the end of the document.</p>
<p>Note: The replacing is not recursive and/or auto-repetitive in any way. Therefore, consider a situtation of replacing a phrase of two spaces with a phrase of only one space, in order to rip multiple spaces off the document. If there is a sequence of ten subsequent spaces in the document, you will have to use the <cite>Replace All</cite> button several times to shrink those ten spaces into one single space. Exectly four times for this ten-spaces example.</p>
<p>Note, that even a replacing search is a search, therefore it is saved and may be used later in all the <cite>Find Next</cite>, the <cite>Find Previous</cite>, the <cite>Select to Next</cite> and the <cite>Select to Previous</cite>, etc. features described above.</p>

<h3>Advanced replacing methods</h3>
<p>Note, that while you may search for a phrase that spreads over multiple lines, there is no way to specify such phrase while replacing, because the <cite>Replace</cite> dialog is required. However, an <cite>Extended Replace</cite> tool is available for replacing of even these phrases. See chapter <a href="#Replacing_tools">Replacing tools</a>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> To <cite>Replace all</cite> when too many occurrences are awaited, or to <cite>Replace all</cite> within the selection only, use much faster and selection-oriented <cite>Extended Replace</cite> tool (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+R</cite>). See chapter <a href="#Replacing_tools">Replacing tools</a>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you need to replace single characters for other single characters, for examle when you need to get rid of encoding or punctuation, use the <cite>Translate Characters</cite> tool instead (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+T</cite>). See chapter <a href="#Replacing_tools">Replacing tools</a>.</p>

<h3>More tips with searching</h3>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you need to select a text between an exact phrase, define such phrase in the <cite>Find</cite> dialog and do not forget to hit the <cite>Find</cite> button at least once before hitting <cite>Cancel</cite> to start a search. Then place the caret somewhere between those phrases where the text is and hit <cite>Select to Next</cite> (hotkey <cite>Shift+F3</cite>) and <cite>Select to Previous</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+Shift+F3</cite>) in order to extend the selection according to the phrases. Note: The phrases will be included in the selection.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you are writing a list in HTML document and using <var>&lt;LI&gt;</var> tags, you may want do specify a search for such <var>&lt;LI&gt;</var> phrase. Then by hitting the <cite>Select to Previous</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+Shift+F3</cite>) feature, entire such list item, that you actually stand on with the caret, will be added to a selection along with the <var>&lt;LI&gt;</var> tag.</p>

The selection will try to persist the loading, placing the <q><a href="#Appendix">actual insertion point</a></q> to the same location. Also, the actual scrolling should persist unchanged.</p>

<h4>Encoding: <span class="system">ANSI</span>/<span class="system">Unicode</span>/<span class="system">UTF-8</span> (Ctrl+U)</h4>
<p>Toggles between saving in <span class="system">ANSI</span>, <span class="system">UTF-8</span> and both <span class="system">Unicode</span> file formats. You can see the actual state of this option in the <cite>Status bar</cite> too.</p>
<p>Note: This option can be toggled also by double-clicking on the <cite>Status bar</cite> field.</p>
<p>See chapter <a href="#Managing_documents">Managing documents</a> for more details on these file formats.</p>

<h4>Newlines: <span class="system">Win</span>/<span class="system">UNIX</span>/<span class="system">Mac</span> (Ctrl+I)</h4>
<p>Toggles between saving in <span class="system">UNIX</span>, <span class="system">Mac</span> and the default <span class="system">Windows</span> file format. You can also see the actual state of this option in the <cite>Status bar</cite>.</p>
<p>This option may be toggled also by double-clicking on the <cite>Status bar</cite> field.</p>
<p>See chapter <a href="#Managing_documents">Managing documents</a> for more details on file formats.</p>

<h4>Print... (Ctrl+P)</h4>
<p>Shows the <cite>Print</cite> dialog and the prints the current document.</p>
<p>Note: While the document is being printed, long lines are wrapped to fit on the page. However, the lines are wrapped to fit the sheet, therefore the actual <cite>word wrapping</cite> used while displaying the document on the screen may be different. If you want to print the document with lines wrapped the same way as they are wrapped while being displayed, use <cite>Commit Word Wrap</cite> tool before printing. See chapter <a href="#Word_Wrap_tools">Word Wrap tools</a> for more details.</p>
<p><b>Versions note:</b> Prior to <b>5.0.1</b>, There were several issues with printing and word wrapping during the printing. The text was not always wrapped correctly. Some early versions did not wrap the lines at all. <b>5.0.1</b> and above should be able to print correctly, as described above.</p>

<h4>Properites... (Ctrl+J)</h4>
<p>Shows the system <span class="system">Properties</span> dialog of the current document. This feature is dissabled, when no document was loaded or when a new document has not been saved yet, because there is no document to show the dialog for.</p>

<h4>Minimize To Tray (Ctrl+M)</h4>
<p>Minimizes (hides) the main application window and adds a small icon to the <span class="system">System Tray</span> area. (i.e. Task Bar area for icons, near the clock.)</p>
<p>To restore (unhide) the window back to its previous position, just click on the icon.</p>

<h4>Recent Files menu</h4>
<p>Shows up to 10 recently opened files.</p>
<p>Note, that files that were not opened successfuly are not collected here. Such unsuccessful open may occur for example when opening a binary file.</p>
<p>Note: <cite>Recent Files</cite> recollection can be turned off in the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog. See chapter <a href="#General_page">General page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog.</p>

<h4>Exit (Esc)</h4>
<p>Closes the current document, then quits upon success. TED Notepad may ask, whether to save the current document before closing.</p>
<p>Note: An optional setting may disable the <cite>Esc</cite> hotkey. See chapter <a href="#General_page">General page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog.</p>

<h4>Save and Exit (F10)</h4>
<p>Saves and closes the current document, then quits upon success.</p>

<h4>Exit wihout saving! (Shift+Esc)</h4>
<p>Closes the current document, but does not ask about to save it! Then quits.</p>
<p>No recently made settings, <cite>Recent files</cite>, <cite>Filters</cite> nor <cite>Favourites</cite> will be saved.</p>
<p>Note: An optional setting may disable the <cite>Shift+Esc</cite> hotkey. See chapter <a href="#General_page">General page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Run TED Notepad with <cite>/ns</cite> command line parameter in order never to save any settings. See chapter <a href="#Command_line_parameters">Command line parameters</a>.</p>

<a name="Edit_menu"></a><h1>Edit menu</h1>
<h4>Undo (Ctrl+Z)</h4>
<p>Undoes the last action.</p>
<p><i><a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE clone</a> specific:</i> <b>Tip:</b> A multi-level <cite>Undo</cite> feature is available. See chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a>.</p>

<h4>Redo (Ctrl+Y)</h4>
<p><i><a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE clone</a> specific:</i> Redoes the last undone action. See chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a>.</p>

<h4>Cut (Ctrl+X) (Shift+Del)</h4>
<p>Deletes the selection and puts it into the Clipboard.</p>

<h4>Copy (Ctrl+C) (Ctrl+Ins)</h4>
<p>Copies the selection into the Clipboard.</p>

<h4>Paste (Ctrl+V) (Shift+Ins)</h4>
<p>Pastes the content of the Clipboard to the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q> or replaces the selection, if any.</p>

<h4>Swap (Ctrl+K) (Ctrl+Shift+Ins)</h4>
<p>Copies the selection into the Clipboard and replaces the selection with previous content of the Clipboard. If no selection is found, it works the same way as <cite>Paste</cite> does.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> It is useful to rotate several pieces from the document without having to put one of them aside for that while. Imagine that you have two words and you need to swap them. Just select the first of them, use <cite>Copy</cite> and then use <cite>Swap</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+K</cite>) on the other one. Finally, go back to the first one and use <cite>Paste</cite>. This way you can rotate as much things as you need.</p>

<h4>Go to... (Ctrl+G)</h4>
<p>Shows the <cite>Go to</cite> dialog and then moves the caret to a specified location.</p>
<p>To jump relatively to the current position, check <cite>Jump relatively</cite>.</p>
<p>To select the text that lies between the current position and the new specified location, check <cite>Select leaped text</cite>. If there is some text already selected, the selection is extended only. Therefore, if the specified location is inside the actual selection, nothing happens.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Combination of <cite>Jump relatively</cite> and <cite>Select leaped text</cite> can help to easily select text of specific length.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> An optional setting may adapt the <cite>Go to Line</cite> behavior when the lines are <cite>wrapped</cite>. See chapter <a href="#General_page">General page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog for more details.</p>
<p><i><a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE clone</a> specific:</i> There is a difference in the <span class="system">RE</span> clone in the <cite>Go to Char</cite> behavior. See chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a> for more details.</p>

<h4>Select All (Ctrl+A)</h4>
<p>Selects all text in the document.</p>

<h4>Select Line (Ctrl+Num*)</h4>
<p>Selects the entire line, which contain the <q><a href="#Appendix">actual insertion point</a></q>; or adds another line to the selection, if any.</p>

<h4>Select Word (Ctrl+Space)</h4>
<p>Selects an entire <q><a href="#Appendix">word</a></q>, all <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> or a single character otherwise, according to what begins or continues to the right from the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>. If there was a selection before, it is de-selected and then a new selection is made. Therefore, if this feature is used subsequently several times, the selection will crawl through the text, <q><a href="#Appendix">word</a></q>-by-<q><a href="#Appendix">word</a></q>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you need to select a <q><a href="#Appendix">word</a></q>, but the double-click on the text selects a lot more than you wish, use this <cite>Select Word</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+Space</cite>) that behaves more softly in this manner.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you are using <cite>Ctrl+Right Arrow</cite> to jump through <q><a href="#Appendix">words</a></q>, but the jumps are too long, try this <cite>Select Word</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+Space</cite>) that behaves more softly in this manner. Note, that you will have to de-select the text, once you reach the desired position.</p>

<h4>Add Next Word (Ctrl+Shift+Space)</h4>
<p>Uses <cite>Select Word</cite> feature (see above), but does not de-select the selection, if any. It extends the actual selection instead.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you need to select several <q><a href="#Appendix">words</a></q>, but the double-click on the text selects a lot more than you wish, use this <cite>Add Next Word</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+Shift+Space</cite>) that behaves more softly in this manner.</p>

<h4>Delete Word (Ctrl+Del)</h4>
<p>Deletes the selection, if any, and then a <q><a href="#Appendix">word</a></q>, all <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> or a single character otherwise, according to what begins or continues to the right from the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>.</p>

<h4>BkSpace Word (Ctrl+BkSpace)</h4>
<p>Deletes the selection, if any, and then a <q><a href="#Appendix">word</a></q>, all <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> or a single character otherwise, according to what begins or continues to the left from the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>.</p>

<h4>Delete Line (Alt+Del)</h4>
<p>Deletes the actual line. If there is any selection it is deleted as well.</p>
<p>Note: If a selection is made from a middle of one line and extends to a middle of another one, the entire selection is deleted and then the rest of the last line. This is similar to deleting the selection at first and then using <cite>Truncate Line</cite> below.</p>

<h4>Truncate Line (Ctrl+Shift+Del)</h4>
<p>Deletes all characters from the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q> up to the end of the line. If there is any selection, it is deleted as well. If the line is wrapped due to actual <cite>word wrapping</cite>, it is deleted only up to the point, where it was wrapped.</p>

<h4>BkSpace Line (Ctrl+Shift+BkSpace)</h4>
<p>Deletes all characters from the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q> up to the beginning of the line. If there is any selection, it is deleted as well. If the line is wrapped due to actual <cite>word wrapping</cite>, it is deleted only up to the point, where it was wrapped.</p>

<h4>Smart Return (Ctrl+Enter)</h4>
<p>Auto-indents the text after returning to a new line by replicating all <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> from a first non-empty previous line. The replication stops, when the previous <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q> is reached or any <q><a href="#Appendix">non-white-space</a></q> character is found.</p>
<p>Note: Usually within TED Notepad, a <q><a href="#Appendix">non-empty</a></q> line means a line that contains no <q><a href="#Appendix">graphs</a></q>. This is not the case with this feature. <cite>Smart Return</cite> always replicates <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> from a first previous line, that is of non-zero length.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> When you are writing a list and you want each item to be indented (i.e. have some spaces at the beginning), type those spaces while writting the first item. TED Notepad will learn, how much of them you actually want for the list. Then hit <cite>Ctrl+Enter</cite> key combination each time you would have used the <cite>Enter</cite> key. This way, each line would contain spaces copied from the previous line, thus all lines of the list would be indented.</p>
<p><b>Versions note:</b> The indentation works regardless to <cite>word wrapping</cite>, but only in versions of 5.0.1 and above. Prior to version 5.0.1, this feature worked with previous line according to the actual <cite>word wrapping</cite>.</p>

<h4>Copying Return (Ctrl+Shift+Enter)</h4>
<p>After returning to a new line, copies all characters from the first non-empty previous line, up to the previos <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>.</p>
<p>Note: Usually within TED Notepad, a <q><a href="#Appendix">non-empty</a></q> line means a line that contains no <q><a href="#Appendix">graphs</a></q>. This is not the case with this feature. <cite>Copying Return</cite> always replicates <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> from a first previous line, that is of non-zero length.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you are writting a list and each of the lines starts with the same text (e.g. the same html tags), you may try to type the part of the line, that is the same for all of the lines and then hit <cite>Copying Return</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</cite>)
subsequently several times. The text you have typed on the first line will be easily copied to several new lines this way. Then you may return to the first line and type the rest of it. When finished, use <cite>Ctrl+Down Arrow</cite> to move to the end of a next line.</p>
<p>Note: <cite>Ctrl+Down Arrow</cite> moves the caret to the next line regardless to any actual <cite>word wrapping</cite>, to a corresponding position. If you will use the technique described above, the next line shall always be short enough for the <cite>Ctrl+Down Arrow</cite> to move the caret to the very end of a next line.</p>
<p>Note: <cite>Copying Return</cite> feature is disabled, when the selection is not empty, because the results would be usually undefined or unwanted according to the selection.</p>
<p><b>Versions note:</b> The indentation works regardless to <cite>word wrapping</cite>, but only in versions of 5.0.1 and above. Prior to version 5.0.1, this feature worked with previous line according to the actual <cite>word wrapping</cite>.</p>

<h4>Copy Word Above (Alt+Ctrl+Space)</h4>
<p>Takes the rest of the word that is above the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q> and copies it into the document.</p>
<p><cite>Copy Word Above</cite> searches within the character column above the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>, checking line after line, until it finds a line that is long enough to provide such word. Note, that it uses a physical character column, assuming that all characters are equaly wide. When using a proportional font, which has characters that are not equaly wide, <cite>Copy Word Above</cite> may seem to work in a strange and peculiar way. This is beacuse it was primarily meant to be used with fixed-width fonts.</p>
<p>Note: <cite>Copy Word Above</cite> always works with unwrapped lines, even if the <cite>word wrapping</cite> is turned on.</p>

<h4>Copy Similar Line (Alt+Shift+Space)</h4>
<p>Takes the rest of the word that is above the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q> and on a line, which starts with the same phrase, and copies it into the document.</p>
<p><cite>Copy Similar Line</cite> searches within the lines above, checking line after line, until it finds a line that contains the same phrase as the current line, considering up to the caret position, and also that is long enough to provide such word. Note, that it uses a physical character column, where all characters are equaly wide. When using a proportional font, which has characters that are not equaly wide, <cite>Copy Similar Line</cite> may seem to work in a strange and peculiar way. This is beacuse it was primarily meant to be used with fixed-width fonts.</p>
<p>Note: <cite>Copy Similar Line</cite> always works with unwrapped lines, even if the <cite>word wrapping</cite> is turned on. </p>
<p>Note: <cite>Copy Similar Line</cite> searches for lines in a <q><a href="#Appendix">case insensitive</a></q> way.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you are writting a list and each of the lines starts with the same phrase (e.g. <var>I would like to do ...</var>), you may use this <cite>Copy Similar Line</cite> at the beginning of the each such line. Hit <cite>Alt+Shift+Space</cite> hotkey several times, up until you reach the position where the lines shall differ. This may save a lot of typing or copy-pasting. Note, that <cite>Copy Similar Line</cite> always searches for a similar line, thus you may also work with two or more such phrases (e.g. <var>I would like to do ...</var> and <var>I would hate to do ...</var>) simultaneously. Just use <cite>Copy Similar Line</cite> up until the position, where they differ, then give it a hint of several characters (e.g. <var>like</var> or <var>hate</var>) and then keep copying until no more hints can be given.</p>

<h4>Complete Word (Ctrl+D)</h4>
<p>Tries to complete an <i>(unfinished)</i> word according to the dictionary calculated from the actual document. E.g. Completes word <var>hel</var> to <var>hello</var>, i there was a <var>hello</var> already in the document.</p>
<p>More accurately, it takes a word just before the caret as a pattern and then searches the entire document for any matching words that consist from that pattern plus some more <q><a href="#Appendix">word letters</a></q> appended. Matching words are <q><a href="#Appendix">uniqued</a></q> and displayed in a listbox to be chosen for the completion.</p>
<p>Note, that the document must already contain the word <var>hello</var> to be able to complete pattern <var>hel</var> to <var>hello</var>. Furthermore, if the document contains word <var>help</var> too, the pattern <var>hel</var> can be completed to both <var>hello</var> and <var>help</var>. User may always choose, which one, from a dialog.</p>
<p>The search for matching words is performed with <q><a href="#Appendix">ignoring case</a></q>, but matching words are then <q><a href="#Appendix">uniqued</a></q> in a <q><a href="#Appendix">case sensitive</a></q> way, therefore completion of pattern <var>hel</var> may result in matches like: <var>Hello</var>, <var>hello</var>, <var>help</var> and also <var>HELL</var>.</p>
<p>Optionally, matching words can be sorted alphabetically in the <cite>Complete Word</cite> dialog. Otherwise, if unsorted, their order is the same as they precede the caret. Therefeore, when typing a sentence <var>What a word can cause to the wide wild world.</var> and then trying to complete a pattern <var>w</var> in a next sentence, matching words would follow as: <var>world</var>, <var>wild</var>, <var>wide</var>, <var>word</var> and <var>What</var>. For details on turning the sorting on in this dialog, see chapter <a href="#General_page">General page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog.</p>
<p>Note: The pattern is a part of a word just preceding the actual caret position. Therefore, no selection is allowed. Furthermore, when
completion is invoked inside of a word, only the preceding part of this word is taken as a pattern.</p>
<p>Note: When a word completion is about to be used without a preceding word (e.g. the caret is placed after a <q><a href="#Appendix">white-space</a></q> or some other <q><a href="#Appendix">non-word</a></q> character), all words in the document are matching. The complete word listing returned in such case may be quite lengthy, therefore, use this feature carefully on very big files.</p>

<a name="Search_menu"></a><h1>Search menu</h1>
<h4>Find... (Ctrl+F)</h4>
<p>Shows the <cite>Find</cite> dialog. After entering search conditions, searches for a specified <cite>Find what</cite> phrase within the document.</p>
<p>If the <cite>Down</cite> direction was specified, search is performed after the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>. Otherwise (for the <cite>Up</cite> direction) it is performed before the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>.</p>
<p>Optionally, a <cite>whole word</cite> option enables to search for whole words only. That means, that a phrase is located in the document only if it is the <cite>Find what</cite> phrase and also if no <q><a href="#Appendix">word letters</a></q> are found directly before and after the phrase. Note, that the phrase itself may consist of <q><a href="#Appendix">non-word letters</a></q> at will, only the context around the phrase is tested.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <cite>match case</cite> option allows to <q><a href="#Appendix">match case</a></q> upon searching.</p>
<p>Note: The <cite>Find</cite> dialog sets and works with the primary search mechanism only. To work with secondary search, see <cite>Look for Selected</cite>, described later in this section.</p>

<h4>Find Next (F3)</h4>
<p>Searches for a next occurrence of the recently specified search within the document after the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>. If no recent search was specified, shows the <cite>Find</cite> dialog.</p>
<p>Note, that if you specify an <cite>Up</cite>-ward search, the previous occurrence becomes the next one and vice versa.</p>
<p>Note: Works with the primary search mechanism.</p>

<h4>Find Previous (Ctrl+F3)</h4>
<p>Searches for a previous occurrence of the recently specified search within the document before the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>. If no recent search was specified, shows the <cite>Find</cite> dialog.</p>
<p>Note, that if you specify an <cite>Up</cite>-ward search, the next occurrence becomes the previous one and vice versa.</p>
<p>Note: Works with the primary search mechanism.</p>

<h4>Find Selected (Alt+F3)</h4>
<p>Resets the primary search. Sets the <cite>Find what</cite> phrase to the content of the selection, sets a <cite>Down</cite>-ward searching direction and turns off both <cite>whole word</cite> and <q><a href="#Appendix">match case</a></q> options. Then searches for a next occurrence.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> There are no restrictions on what the selection may or may not contain. You may easily select text over multiple lines and start a search for such a multi-line phrase.</p>

<h4>Find Later (Alt+Ctrl+F)</h4>
<p>Resets the primary search. Sets the <cite>Find what</cite> phrase to the content of the selection, sets a <cite>Down</cite>-ward searching direction and turns off both <cite>whole word</cite> and <q><a href="#Appendix">match case</a></q> options.</p>
<p>Note: In contrast to the <cite>Find Selected</cite> feature above, this one does not search for the next occurrence immediately.</p>

<h4>Replace (Ctrl+R)</h4>
<p>Shows the <cite>Replace</cite> dialog. After entering search conditions and a <cite>Replace with</cite> phrase, searches for a specified <cite>Find what</cite> phrase within the document and replaces it with the <cite>Replace with</cite> phrase.</p>
<p>See the description of <cite>Find...</cite> above for other informations about search conditions and/or options.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> To <cite>Replace all</cite> when too many occurrences are awaited, or to <cite>Replace all</cite> within the selection only, use much faster and selection-oriented <cite>Extended Replace</cite> tool (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+R</cite>). See chapter <a href="#Replacing_tools">Replacing tools</a>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you need to replace individual characters for other characters, for examle, to get rid of encoding or punctuation, use the <cite>Translate Characters</cite> tool instead (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+T</cite>). See chapter <a href="#Replacing_tools">Replacing tools</a>.</p>
<p>Note: The <cite>Replace</cite> dialog sets and works with the primary search mechanism.</p>

<h4>Select to Next (Shift+F3)</h4>
<p>Searches for a next occurrence of the recently specified search using <cite>Find Next</cite> feature. Then extends the selection to cover the found phrase too, if any.</p>
<p>Note: Works with the primary search mechanism.</p>

<h4>Select to Previous (Ctrl+Shift+F3)</h4>
<p>Searches for a previous occurrence of the recently specified search using <cite>Find Previous</cite> feature. Then extends the selection to cover the found phrase too, if any.</p>
<p>Note: Works with the primary search mechanism.</p>

<h4>Look for Selected (Alt+F2)</h4>
<p>Starts a new secondary search. Searches for a next occurrence of the content of the actual selection. This secondary search is always downward and <q><a href="#Appendix">ignoring case</a></q>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> There are no restrictions on what the selection may or may not contain. You may easily select text over multiple lines and start a search for such a multi-line phrase.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Imagine that you want to search for a word <var>name</var> after an id <var>12345</var>. There are hundreds of <var>name</var>-s in the document but only one such id. And you want to search for id-s like this quite repeatedly. Well, define a second search for the word <var>name</var>, then find a desired id and hit second search... There you are, instead of scrolling again and again.</p>

<h4>Look for Next (F2)</h4>
<p>Searches for a next occurrence of the recently specified secondary search within the document after the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>.</p>
<p>Note: Works with the secondary search mechanism.</p>

<h4>Look for Previous (Ctrl+F2)</h4>
<p>Searches for a next occurrence of the recently specified secondary search within the document before the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>.</p>
<p>Note: Works with the secondary search mechanism.</p>

<a name="Clipboards_menu"></a><h1>Clipboards menu</h1>
<p>This menu provides an access to <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite>. These nine clipboards can be used within TED Notepad the same way, as the standard clipboard of Windows can be.</p>
<p>The content of these <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite> is usually being saved between sessions, therefore it persists even through computer restarts. <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite> can be easily pre-configured and then used later to quikly paste frequent phrases and/or code snippets.</p>
<p>Press <cite>Alt</cite> key with a digit <cite>[1..9]</cite> to copy the selection into one of the <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite>.
Press <cite>Ctrl</cite> key with the same digit to paste the content from the <cite>Extended Clipboard</cite> back to the document.</p>
<p>Note: The content of these <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite> is saved with other settings, when TED Notepad quits, but it is not shared with other applications. Therefore, even with two instances of TED Notepad running concurrently, they each opperate with a different set of these <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite>.</p>
<p>Note: If saving of the content of the <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite> is turned off in settings; or the <cite>/ns</cite> command line parameter is used; or the <cite>Exit without saving!</cite> is used; content of <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite> is not saved at all, and will not persist the session.

<p>The <cite>Status Bar</cite> indicates:</p>

<ul>
<li>the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q> (i.e. cursor position);</li>
<li>type of encoding, which the document is to be saved in (i.e. <span class="system">Unicode</span>, <span class="system">ANSI</span> or <span class="system">UTF-8</span>);</li>
<li>type of newlines that are to be used upon saving (i.e. <span class="system">Win</span>, <span class="system">UNIX</span> or <span class="system">Mac</span>);</li>
<li>and whether any modifications to the document have been made after the last <cite>Save</cite> operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Some later testing versions of TED Notepad may use the <cite>Status Bar</cite> also to display some other info.</p>
<p>Note: Using the Status Bar when very large files are opened may significantly slow down the performance. If you load a lot of data and the movement and editing becomes too slow, try turning the Status Bar off.</p>

<h4>Show Margin Bar</h4>
<p>Shows or hides the <cite>Margin Bar</cite>, which is a vertical line indicating a text margin. However, it does not affect the way the text is being automatically word wrapped. It is only supposed to help with manual word wrapping or other specific formatting. It is a better way than using the right edge of the window.</p>
<p>The position of the <cite>Margin Bar</cite> can be adjusted any time by clicking on the line and dragging it.</p>
<p>Note: The position of the <cite>Margin Bar</cite> does not change upon any scrolling, even the horizontal one.</p>

<h4>Stay on Top (Ctrl+T)</h4>
<p>If checked, TED Notepad stays in front of other applications even if not active.</p>
<p>Note: If more than one application is in a such a stay on top mode on the desktop, their order on the screen depends on the System. There is no way to ensure, that any particular one will be the topmost of them.</p>

<h4>Word Wrap (Ctrl+W)</h4>
<p>If checked, the every line of the document is wrapped to fit the width of the window. Wrapping the text enables user to see all the text on the line, but it does not affect the way the text appears when it is printed or saved to a file.</p>

<h4>Fixed-width Font (F8)</h4>
<p>If checked, a <span class="system">fixed-width</span> font is used to display the text of the current document. Otherwise, a <span class="system">proportional</span> font is used.</p>
<p>Both these fonts may be changed and managed in the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog. See chapter <a href="#General_page">General page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog.</p>

<h4>Settings... (Alt+Enter)</h4>
<p>Shows the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog which is described in the chapter <a href="#Settings_dialog">Settings dialog</a>.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<a name="View_scrolling"></a><h1>View scrolling</h1>
<p>TED Notepad provides a variety of scrolling hotkeys, all derived from standard movement keys. To start scrolling, just hold down the <cite>Alt</cite> key and then use common movement keys:</p>

<ul>
<li><cite>Alt+Arrows</cite> to scroll only a little,</li>
<li><cite>Alt+Shift+Arrows</cite> to scroll by larger steps,</li>
<li><cite>Alt+Page Up</cite> and <cite>Alt+Page Down</cite> to scroll by entire pages,</li>
<li><cite>Alt+Home</cite> and <cite>Alt+End</cite> to scroll to the beginning or to the end of the document</li>
<li>and finally <cite>Alt+Insert</cite> to scroll back to the actual position of the caret, or to the current selection, if any.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<a name="Drag_.26_Drop"></a><h1>Drag &amp; Drop</h1>
<p>A file can also be opened by draging it from the Windows Explorer and dropping onto TED Notepad window. The document is loaded in the same way as if it was chosen in the <cite>Open</cite> dialog.</p>
<p>If multiple files are dropped, only the first one will be opened as described above. However, TED Notepad will ask, whether to load all other files too. If so, all files will be joinded into one document.</p>
<p>Note, that title of the document after such a join will remain equal to the document from the first file. The document itself will become modified as if the other files were typed in manually and when it is saved, all the text from all of the joined files will be written to the first file.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<a name="xLOG_extension"></a><h1>.LOG extension</h1>
<p>This feature was implemented as a demand for the capability of the original Windows Notepad: a log appending feature.</p>
<p>To append a log to a document each time it is opened, type the <var>.LOG</var> extension, on the first line of the document. It must begin at the very left margin. Also make sure to use all uppercase letters and to include the period.</p>
<p>When a document is loaded and this extension is found at its beginning, an actual time/date stamp will be appended to the document using the <cite>Time/Date</cite> tool.</p>

There must be no <q><a href="#Appendix">white-space</a></q> between a parameter and its value, if any. Some of the parameters are exclusive and should not be used together, or the result may be undefined otherwise and may change from version to version.</p>

<h4>/l<var>xx</var> <cite>Go to Line</cite></h4>
<p>After the file is loaded, automatically moves the caret to the beginning of the line <var>xx</var>. If there are not so many lines, the caret remains at the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>This parameter excludes <cite>/s</cite> and <cite>/a</cite> parameters.</p>

<h4>/c<var>xx</var> <cite>Go to Char</cite></h4>
<p>After the file is loaded, automatically moves the caret to the character <var>xx</var>. If there are not so many characters, the caret is moved to the end of the document.</p>
<p>This parameter excludes <cite>/s</cite> and <cite>/a</cite> parameters.</p>
<p>Use this parameter along with the <cite>/l</cite> parameter to jump to a specific column on a specific line. If the chosen line is too short, the caret is placed respectively somewhere beyond it. In other words, when used in  conjuction with <cite>/l</cite> parameter, the <cite>/c</cite> parameter behaves relatively to the line from the <cite>/l</cite> parameter.</p>
<p>Note: The caret is moved only after all the <q><a href="#Appendix">newline</a></q> conversions are already done. If a Unix-type file is loaded and automatically identified, each <q><a href="#Appendix">newline</a></q> is converted into two characters (i.e. <var>CR/LF</var>).

<hr />

<a name="Portable_INI_file"></a><h1>Portable INI file</h1>
<p>TED Notepad is able to store its settings also portably in an INI file, so it can be easilly moved from one computer to another on a USB flash disk or a Floppy disk, carrying its settings along.</p>
<p>The INI file must be placed in the same directory, where the executable file is. It must be named <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> (the name is usually <q><a href="#Appendix">case insensitive</a></q>).</p>
<p>When TED Notepad is starting, it searches for that INI file. When successful, it loads its settings from the INI file. Then, upon exit, all settings are always saved back to the INI file, even if it is deleted or modified in the meantime.</p>
<p>When the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> file is not found, TED Notepad loads its settings from the user registry.</p>
<p>While saving the settings (e.g. upon exit), TED Notepad searches for the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> file again.
If the file is found, it stores the settings into it regardless of whether they were loaded from the registry or from the INI file before. This can be useful to convert your current settings from the registry to the portable INI file.</p>
<p>Note: There is currently no way to convert the settings from the INI file back to the registry. Once TED Notepad finds the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> file, all settings are stored there in that session.</p>
<p>Note: Because the INI file must be stored in the same directory, where the executable is, it is not recommended to install TED Notepad with this portable INI file to a <span class="system">Program files</span> folder or as a default notepad replacement, because end users would be probably completely restricted from writing their settings.</p>
<p>Note: By setting a read-only attribute to the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> file, you will prevent TED Notepad from saving new settings. When you set this attribute on an empty file, you can ensure the default settings forever.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> If you are writting a list (or a table) in an HTML document, you may write all the lines of such a list first without having to bother with all the HTML tags. Then select all the lines, hit this <cite>Indent/Quote Selection...</cite> tool (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+Q</cite>) and enter phrase like <var>&lt;LI&gt;</var> as the <cite>Quote</cite> phrase.</p>

<h4>Unquote (Ctrl+Shift+Q)</h4>
<p>Takes the very first character of the selection as a <i>quoting character</i>. Then removes the first character on each <q><a href="#Appendix">line</a></q> of the selection, if the character is the <i>quoting character</i>.</p>
<p>Note: It is very similar to the <cite>Unindent Selection</cite> tool, but it is not space-oriented only.</p>

<h4>Shift Left (Alt+Ctrl+Shift+Q)</h4>
<p>Removes the first character from each <q><a href="#Appendix">line</a></q> of the selection, no matter what it is.</p>
<p>Note: Tabs are treated as single characters.</p>

<h4>Tabify (Alt+Ctrl+O)</h4>
<p>Tabifies the indentation of the selection by replacing leading Spaces with Tabs on each <q><a href="#Appendix">line</a></q>. While replacing, the Spaces are being grouped together according to the <cite>Tab Size</cite> setting. Each set of Spaces is then replaced by a Tab.</p>
<p>If Tabs and Spaces are mixed together on the beginning of a line, the total <q><a href="#Appendix">white-space</a></q> outcome is calculated first and then Tabs and then Spaces are used to fill the occupied <i>white space</i>. Tabs always precede Spaces and Spaces are used only, when a Tab would extend the original <q><a href="#Appendix">white-space</a></q> outcome.</p>
<p>Note: Using this tool sould not generate any visible changes, when using a fixed-width fonts. However, some proportional fonts do not use the average character width for Spaces, thus a Tab may seem to be longer than a set of Spaces.</p>
<p>Note: This tool does not modify other than leading Spaces.</p>

<h4>Untabify (Ctrl+Shift+O)</h4>
<p>Untabifies the indentation of the selection by replacing leading Tabs with Spaces on each <q><a href="#Appendix">line</a></q>. While replacing, the Tabs are being replaced by multiple Spaces according to the <cite>Tab Size</cite> setting.</p>
<p>If Tabs and Spaces are mixed together on the beginning of a line, the total <q><a href="#Appendix">white-space</a></q> outcome is calculated first and then Spaces are used to fill the occupied <i>white space</i>.</p>
<p>Note: Using this tool sould not generate any visible changes, when using a fixed-width fonts. However, some proportional fonts do not use the average character width for Spaces, thus a Tab may seem to be longer than a set of Spaces.</p>
<p>Note: This tool does not modify other characters than leading Tabs.</p>

<h4>Close... (Alt+Ctrl+C)</h4>
<p>Asks for a <cite>Close with</cite> phrase to work with and then closes each <q><a href="#Appendix">line</a></q> of the selection with the specified phrase. Optionally, only <q><a href="#Appendix">non-empty lines</a></q> can be closed.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> As the example above shows, if you are writting an HTML document, you may write all the text of such a document first without having to bother with all the HTML tags. Then select the text, hit this <cite>Close Lines...</cite> tool (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+C</cite>) and enter whatever phrase is needed after each line (e.g. a <var>&lt;bt&gt;</var> tag).</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> According to the tips and examples above, you may simply combine the <cite>Indent/Quote Selection...</cite> tool with <cite>Close Lines...</cite> tool in order to write paragraphs in an HTML document without having to bother with <var>&lt;p&gt;</var> tags at first. Write all the paragraphs first, each one on a single line (use <cite>word wrapping</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+W</cite>) in order to see entire paragraphs wrapped into several lines). Then select all the paragraphs and use both <cite>Indent/Quote Selection...</cite> and <cite>Close Lines...</cite> tools in order to add the <var>&lt;p&gt;</var> and <var>&lt;/p&gt;</var> tags.</p>

<h4>Trim Spaces (Ctrl+Shift+C)</h4>
<p>Removes all <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> from the end of each <q><a href="#Appendix">line</a></q> of the selection.</p>

<h4>Columns, Numbers... (Alt+Ctrl+Y)</h4>
<p>Cuts portions from each <q><a href="#Appendix">line</a></q> and then gnerates new <q><a href="#Appendix">lines</a></q> according to the given <cite>Output mask</cite>. The mask may contain any text, and may also include these special variables:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>%0</b> - returns the entire original line.</li>
<li><b>%1</b>-<b>%9</b> - return the columns cut according to rules specified in the corresponding tab.</li>
<li><b>%d</b> - returns a decimal number from the <cite>Counter</cite>. You may specify the <cite>Start</cite> and the <cite>Step</cite>.</li>
<li><b>%x</b> - returns a lower case hexadecimal number from the <cite>Counter</cite>.</li>
<li><b>%X</b> - returns an upper case hexadecimal number from the <cite>Counter</cite>.</li>
<li><b>%b</b> - returns a binary number from the <cite>Counter</cite>.</li>
<li><b>%o</b> - returns an octal number from the <cite>Counter</cite>.</li>
<li><b>%n</b> - returns a simple newline.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these veriables might be furthermore qualified with an aligning specifier:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>&lt;</b> - aligns the entire column to the left, using spaces to fill the shorter lines from right.</li>
<li><b>&gt;</b> - aligns the entire column to the right, using spaces to fill the shorter lines from left.</li>
<li><b>+</b> - aligns the entire column to the right, using 0 to fill the shorter lines from left.</li>
<li><b>^</b> - aligns the entire column to the center, using spaces to fill the shorter lines from both sides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optionally, you may choose to <cite>Modify non-empty lines only</cite>, if you need to keep the <q><a href="#Appendix">empty</a></q> lines intact.</p>
<p><br />
Example of an <cite>Output mask</cite>. This mask will cut the first column from each line and place it in the results after a decimal number, colon and a space. The numbers will be aligned to the right by zeroes, so that they all have the same number of digits:</p>

<table class="tnp_example">

<tr>
<td>%+d, %1</td>
</tr></table>
<h4>Unique (Alt+Ctrl+X)</h4>
<p>Searches the selection for equal <q><a href="#Appendix">lines</a></q> and removes all duplicates. The order of the uniqued lines remains unchanged and from each two equal lines, the second one is removed.</p>
<p>Note: Use <cite><b>Shift</b>+Alt+Ctrl+X</cite> hotkey in order to <q><a href="#Appendix">ignore case</a></q> when matching duplicates.</p>

<table class="tnp_example">
<caption>Example:</caption>

<p><b>Tip:</b> If you need, for example, a complete word listing of a document, use the <cite>Extended Replace</cite> tool in order to replace all the spaces, commas, dots, etc. by new lines. Then use this <cite>Unique Lines</cite> tool, which will give you the complete listing of all words.</p>

<h4>Find duplicates... (Ctrl+Shift+X)</h4>
<p>Works the same way as the <cite>Unique Lines</cite> tool does, but allows more options affecting the behavior of the tool:</p>

<ul>
<li><cite>All lines</cite> - identical to the behavior of the Unique Lines tool.</li>
<li><cite>Only unique lines</cite> - only lines that does not have duplicates are included in the result.</li>
<li><cite>Only duplicated lines</cite> - only lines that have at least one duplicate are included in the result.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <cite>Count duplicates</cite> option adds to the result the actual numbers of equal lines. Each resulting line will contain a number of its duplicates, written in brackets before the line.</p>

<h4>Translate Characters... (Alt+Ctrl+T)</h4>
<p>Asks for <cite>Find what</cite> and <cite>Translate to</cite> <q><a href="#Appendix">strings</a></q>. Then translates in the selection all occurrences of each character from <cite>Find what</cite> to the corresponding character from <cite>Translate to</cite>. If <cite>Translate to</cite> <q><a href="#Appendix">string</a></q> is shorter than <cite>Find what</cite>, the extra characters from <cite>Find what</cite> are being deleted from the selection instead of translating.</p>
<p>Optionally, it can <cite>Delete all other characters</cite> that are not included in <cite>Find what</cite> string. Note: Even if <cite>Delete all other characters</cite> is turned on, if <cite>Translate to</cite> string is shorter than <cite>Find what</cite> string, the extra characters are deleted too.</p>
<p>Note: This tool is always <q><a href="#Appendix">case sensitive</a></q>. Convert the text to lower case before this tool to gain case insensitive behaviour.</p>

<h4>Extended Replace... (Alt+Ctrl+R)</h4>
<p>Searches for all occurrences of a specified <cite>Find what</cite> phrase within the selection and replaces them with <cite>Replace with</cite> phrase.</p>
<p>Use <cite>Ignore case</cite> option to <q><a href="#Appendix">ignore case</a></q> during the search. <cite>Whole words</cite> option allows to search for phrases strictly delimited by <q><a href="#Appendix">non-word</a></q> characters.</p>
<p>Note: Newlines and Tab characters can be used in <cite>Find what</cite> and <cite>Replace with</cite> phrases freely.</p>
<p>Note: This tool is prefered to standard <cite>Find/Replace All</cite> mechanism in many cases. The reasons are, that its search is done in more complex way and the replacing routine works much more faster and uses much less resources. Furthermore, the selection ensures, that the replacing is done only in the desired part of the text. And finally, the <cite>Undo</cite> feature undoes all replacements together, instead of only the last one. The <cite>Find/Replace All</cite> mechanism behaves the very same way as in the original Windows Notepad does, but that makes it unusable on large files with many occurrences.</p>
<p>Note: All UNICODE characters are supported on UNICODE versions.</p>

<h4>Enclose Selection (Alt+Ctrl+E)</h4>
<p>Asks for two phrases and then encloses the selection with them. The first one (<cite>Before</cite>) is placed before the selection, the second one (<cite>After</cite>) is placed after the selection.</p>
<p>If there is nothing selected while using this tool, then the caret is placed between the two inserted strings.</p>

<table class="tnp_example">
<caption>Example:</caption>
<tr>
<td>TED Notepad for Windows is a <samp>freeware</samp> text editor, ...</td>

</tr></table>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you have written an HTML document and you need to make several phrases to be bold, e.g. each occurrence of a specific word, then use <cite>Find...</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+F</cite>) to select first such word, hit <cite>Enclose Selection</cite> (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+E</cite>), enter phrases <cite>Before</cite>: <var>&lt;b&gt;</var> and <cite>After</cite>: <var>&lt;/b&gt;</var> and hit <cite>Enclose</cite> button. The selected word will be enclosed with the <i>bolding</i> tags. Then, use <cite>Find Next</cite> (hotkey <cite>F3</cite>) to select all the other occurrences, one by one. Each time hit <cite>Last Tool</cite> (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+L</cite>), in order to use <cite>Enclose Selection</cite> on each of them.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Note that if you need to enclose entire subsequent lines, it is better to select all of them at once and use <cite>Indent/Quote Selection...</cite> tool (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+Q</cite>) and then <cite>Close Lines...</cite> tool (hotkey <cite>Alt+Ctrl+C</cite>) instead of selecting each one of them separately and performing the <cite>Enclose Selection</cite> again and again.</p>

<h4>XML/HTML Tag (Ctrl+Shift+H)</h4>
<p>Asks for a <cite>Tag name</cite> and for its <cite>Attributes</cite>. Then encloses the selection with generated XML/HTML tag. If no selection is found, the caret is placed between the two generated strings: the starting tag and the ending tag.</p>
<p>The tag may be <cite>Empty</cite> which means that only the starting tag is generated with slash at its end according to XML specification (e.g. &lt;br /&gt;). In this case, if a selection is found, the tag is placed at the end of the selection.</p>
<p>Note: It is usually profitable to turn on the <cite>Persistent selections in Tools</cite> setting in the <cite>Settings dialog</cite>. See chapter <a href="#General_page">General page</a> of the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog.</p>

<h4>Compare... (Alt+Ctrl+M)</h4>
<p>Shows the <cite>Compare</cite> dialog, where two <q><a href="#Appendix">strings</a></q> can be inserted and compared, optionally <q><a href="#Appendix">ignoring case</a></q>.</p>
<p>If the two compared strings are not equal, the difference is marked by a selection within the first string and a warning is given. Note: If the strings are equal only up to the length of the first one, the caret is placed to the end of the first one. Nothing is selected.</p>
<p>Note: If the selection is not empty, it is auto-inserted to the edit box of the first string. The same font is used within the <cite>Compare</cite> dialog, as is specified for the main window.</p>

<h4>Statistics... (F9)</h4>
<p>Shows the <cite>Statistics</cite> dialog with a lot of calculated info about the document and the selection. Description of some terms used in the <cite>Statistics</cite> dialog can be found in the section <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a>.</p>

<p>Inserts a full path and a file name of the actual document to the actual <q><a href="#Appendix">insertion point</a></q>.</p>

<h4>Include File (Alt+Ctrl+I)</h4>
<p>Asks for a file and then pastes the content of the file to the current caret position or replaces the selection, if any.</p>
<p>Note: Yet, this tool can not load multiple files at once. The only way, how to load and join multiple files at once, is to use the <cite>Drag &amp; Drop</cite> feature, described in the section <a href="#Drag_.26_Drop">Drag &amp; Drop</a>. I hope, that this posibility, to include and join multiple files also with <cite>Include from File</cite>, will be added in the future.</p>

<h4>Sort Ascending (Alt+Ctrl+A)</h4>
<p>Simply sorts <q><a href="#Appendix">lines</a></q> of the selecion in ascending order, comparing the entire lines as simple text. Does not ignore case or any characters.</p>

<h4>Sort Descending (Alt+Ctrl+Z)</h4>
<p>Simply sorts <q><a href="#Appendix">lines</a></q> of the selecion in descending order, comparing the entire lines as simple text. Does not ignore case or any characters.</p>

<h4>Sort... (Alt+Ctrl+S)</h4>
<p>Shows <cite>Sort Selection</cite> dialog and asks for <cite>sorting keys</cite>. Then sorts <q><a href="#Appendix">lines</a></q> of the selection according to the given <cite>keys</cite>.</p>
<p>When lines of the selection are being sorted, they are compared against each other and the <cite>sorting keys</cite> are supposed to specify, how to do that. You can use up to three such <cite>keys</cite>, named <cite>At first...</cite>, <cite>Then...</cite> and <cite>Finally...</cite>. If two lines are equal acording to the 1<sup>st</sup> <cite>key</cite>, then the 2<sup>nd</sup> <cite>key</cite> is used (and the 3<sup>rd</sup> <cite>key</cite> alike).</p>
<p>Note: The <cite>sorting keys</cite> are used only to sort the lines, e.g. to decide, which one goes first and which one will be the second one. The lines are not being modified during the sorting; only the order of them.</p>
<p>Each <cite>sorting key</cite> may specify:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Whether to sort by that key, or not.</dt>
<dd>There is usually no need to define more than one <cite>key</cite>, therefore the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> keys are disabled by default.</dd>
<dd>Note: You can not sort by the 3<sup>rd</sup> key, if you are not sorting by the 2<sup>nd</sup> key as well.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Whether to use an entire line or only a specific <cite>column</cite> for the comparisons.</dt>
<dd> When lines are being compared, only this <q><a href="#Appendix">column</a></q> is taken into account, disregarding any other line content.</dd>
<dd>Note: The <q><a href="#Appendix">column</a></q> is being allocated for each line separately, therefore the total number of columns on a line may vary from line to line. If you run out of columns on a line, you get an empty column for that line.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dt>None, one or more <cite>column delimiters</cite> may be specified.</dt>
<dd>Each <q><a href="#Appendix">delimiting</a></q> character is treated independently and are all <q><a href="#Appendix">case sensitive</a></q>. You can, for example, dilimit columns by Spaces and also by Tabs. Then each Space or Tab (whatever comes first) starts a new column.</dd>
<dd>Example: A line <var>HELLO&nbsp;WORLD</var> would be:
<ul>
<li>divided into two columns (<var>HELLO</var> and <var>WORLD</var>), if delimited by a Space character;</li>
<li>divided into four columns (<var>H</var>, <var>LL</var>, <var>&nbsp;W</var> and <var>RLD</var>), if delimited by a set of <var>EO</var> characters;</li>
<li>divided into four columns (<var>HE</var>, <var>{empty}</var>, <var>O&nbsp;WOR</var> and <var>D</var>), if delimited by a single <var>L</var> character;</li>
<li>and <i>divided</i> into only one column (<var>HELLO&nbsp;WORLD</var>), if delimited by an <var>X</var> character or if <i>delimited</i> by no characters.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Whether to <cite>treat a sequence of delimiters as a single delimiter</cite>.</dt>
<dd>Tells that any sequence of a single delimiter is to be treated as a single delimiter. For example, in a string with several consecutive Spaces, all sequences of Spaces will be grouped together first. Only then the line will be divided into columns.</dd>
<dd>Note: A sequence of multiple delimiters is not treated as a single delimiter. If a Space is followed by a Tab, both Space and Tab are delimiters, they will delimit three columns instead of two, leaving the second column empty.</dd>
<dd>Example: If this option is checked, a line <var>HELLO&nbsp;WORLD</var> would be divided into only three columns (<var>HE</var>, <var>O&nbsp;WOR</var> and <var>D</var>), if delimited by a single <var>L</var> character, exactly as if there was only one single <var>L</var> in the word <var>HELLO</var>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Whether to <cite>count columns backwards</cite>.</dt>
<dd>If this option is checked, then a column 1 from left is the last column, column 2 from the left is the penultimate column, etc. Note again, that columns are set for each line separately, therefore total number of columns on a line may vary from line to line. If you run out of columns on a line, you get an empty column for that line.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Whether to <cite>use only a char range</cite>.</dt>
<dd>If this option is checked, then only this <q><a href="#Appendix">char range</a></q> of a chosen column is used when sorting lines. Note, that the columns are calculated first. Only then the <q><a href="#Appendix">char range</a></q> is cut from the resulting column. If you run out of chars in the column, you get an empty string for that line, even if the line originally continued after the column.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Whether to <cite>count the char range backwards</cite>.</dt>
<dd>Very similar to <cite>count columns backwards</cite> above.</dd>
<dd>Note, that even if a <q><a href="#Appendix">char range</a></q> is counted backwards, the comparing of two lines is performed normally, from left to right. If you wish to compare lines backward, try to use the Reverse Lines tool to reverse the lines before and after the sort. For details see chapter <a href="#Replacing_tools">Replacing tools</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Sorting <cite>Direction</cite>: <cite>ascending</cite> or <cite>descending</cite>.</dt>
<dd>The tool always uses the actual locale settings to decide the order of the lines.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Whether to compare two lines <cite>as numbers</cite> or <cite>as text</cite>.</dt>
<dd>Note, that number <var>112</var> is greater than number <var>12</var> if sorted as numbers, but it is smaller if sorted as text.
<dl>
<dt>Sorting numbers</dt>
<dd>While sorting as numbers, all spaces are automatically ignored. TED Notepad is able to sort numbers of any length. The numebers may contain one decimal point and may start with a minus sign.</dd>
<dd>The comparison of two numbers is halted, when a first non-allowed character is found. The allowed characters are <var>0-9</var>, <var>a-z</var>, one decimal point, a minus sign at the beginning and all <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q>.</dd>
<dd>The numbers may be in decimal, binary, hexadecimal or any other scale. The only important thing is, that both compared numbers must be in the same scale. This also means, that you cannot compare a line like <var>13 pigs</var> against a line like <var>13 elephants</var>, because the letters are valid numerals. In this case, <var>13 pigs</var> are greater that <var>13 elephants</var>.
<dl>
<dd><small>Actually, <var>1 woman</var> is always more than <var>1 man</var> no matter what... On the other hand, <var>1$ woman</var> and <var>1$ man</var> are equal when compared <cite>as numbers</cite>.</small></dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Whether to <cite>ignore case</cite> when comparing two lines.</dt>
<dd>The <q><a href="#Appendix">case</a></q> is always <q><a href="#Appendix">ignored</a></q> when sorting <cite>as numbers</cite>.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Whether to <cite>ignore specific characters</cite>, when comparing two lines.</dt>
<dd>If a character is to be ignored, it is completely stripped from both lines when they are being compared.</dd>
<dd>Note: While comparing as lines, you can not specify, which characters are to be ignored.</dd>
<dd>Note: The resulting lines are not modified, and the ignored characters are not stripped from the results.</dd>

<a name="Text_Filters"></a><h1>Text Filters</h1>
<h4>Inspiration</h4>
<p><q>How about a plugin architecture? Something simple - just a list of menu names and programs to run and maybe an indication of whether it should prompt for additional parameters. TED will run the program with those parameters and with the actual selection and then accept the output back into the TED workspace.</q> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(--- anonymous user ---)</i></p>

<h4>Architecture</h4>
<p>Each <cite>filter</cite> must be defined as a runnable command, consisting of an application file to execute and its parameters. System commands may be executed only through a <span class="system">command interpreter</span> (i.e. <span class="system">cmd.exe</span>, <span class="system">command.com</span>, <span class="system">launch.exe</span>) as described below.</p>
<p>Each <cite>filter</cite> can define up to 9 <cite>variables</cite> in the command. Use batch variable syntax (i.e. <var>%1</var>, <var>%2</var>, ..., <var>%9</var>) to define those <cite>variables</cite> in the command. When the <cite>filter</cite> is to be used, a dialog will appear to ask for values of the <cite>variables</cite>. Furthermore, special <var>%F</var> variable can be used to refer to an actual path and file name of the current document. This can be used to run an external viewer (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox).</p>

<table class="tnp_example">
<caption>Example:</caption>
<tr>
<td>myapp.exe %1

myapp.exe /a %1 /b /c&quot;%2&quot;

myapp.exe /a %1 /b /c&quot;%1&quot;

myviewer.exe /a %1 /b &quot;%F&quot;</td>
</tr></table>
<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>When a <cite>filter</cite> is to be executed, a new process is started using the command of that <cite>filter</cite>. All defined <cite>variables</cite> are replaced with values. The selection is then given to the <span class="system">stdin</span><sup>1</sup> of the started process. After the process returns, its <span class="system">stdout</span><sup>2</sup> or <span class="system">stderr</span><sup>3</sup> is read, depending on what value the process returned. Finally, the selection is replaced with the output of the process or an error is displayed, containing the returned error code and the content of the <span class="system">stderr</span><sup>3</sup>. All inputs/outputs are Non-UNICODE.</p>
<p>If the <var>%F</var> variable is used, the document is automatically saved before the execution of the filter and the <var>%F</var> is replaced by the actual path and file name of the current document. The selection is ignored (neglected), which means, that nothing is written to filter's <span class="system">stdin</span> and no output is awaited from filter's <span class="system">stdout</span>. <var>%F</var> variable can be useful to define an external viewer which does not read the <span class="system">stdin</span> at all but requires a file name to start on.</p>

<dl>
<dd><small><sup>1</sup> <span class="system">standard console input</span></small></dd>
<dd><small><sup>2</sup> <span class="system">standard console output</span></small></dd>
<dd><small><sup>3</sup> <span class="system">standard console error output</span></small></dd>
</dl>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>An application defined in <cite>filter</cite>'s command should read the <span class="system">stdin</span> for input text and should output any results to the <span class="system">stdout</span>. If the operation is successful, the application should return zero. Otherwise it should return non-zero value and optionally describe the error to the <span class="system">stderr</span>.</p>
<p>Note: Some languages (like Pascal) does not support <span class="system">stderr</span> at all. Therefore, if a non-zero return code is received and <span class="system">stderr</span> is empty, <span class="system">stdout</span> is expected to contain the error description.</p>
<p>If an application file name ends with an <var>.exe</var> extension, it is not necessary to use it in the command, but it may be necessary otherwise. The command can specify the full path and file name of the application to execute as well as only the file name. In the case of a missing path, system uses the current working directory and system directories when searching for the application.</p>
<p>System commands need to be executed through a <span class="system">command interpreter</span>, as they do not have any file names to be executed. Use standard <span class="system">command interpreters</span> (i.e. <span class="system">cmd.exe</span> on Win NT/2000/XP, <span class="system">command.com</span> on Win 9x/ME) or the <span class="system">launch.exe</span> interpreter, which is included in the installation package and installed with TED Notepad.</p>

<h4>How to create a filter's application?</h4>
<p>Very easy! Any programming language that can be compiled to 16-bit/32-bit console application (i.e. PE files with an .exe extension) may be used (like c/c++, pascal, qbasic, ...). Such application should use its <span class="system">stdin</span> for input, its <span class="system">stdout</span> for output and its <span class="system">stderr</span> in the case of failure/error (which are used by default in these languages). It should return zero upon success or non-zero value upon failure. No other requirements/restrictions are specified.</p>
<p>Note: Some languages (like Pascal) do not define any <span class="system">stderr</span>. Therefore, all error messages could also be written to the <span class="system">stdout</span>. When a non-zero error code is returned and no <span class="system">stderr</span> is started, the <span class="system">stdout</span> is supposed to be used instead of the <span class="system">stderr</span> for any error messages to be displayed to the user.</p>
<p>Note: Actually, both <span class="system">stdout</span> and <span class="system">stderr</span> are displayed to the user upon a non-zero error code. This behaviour may change in the future, according to the suggestions of the end users. The <span class="system">stderr</span> is and will be preffered.</p>

<table class="tnp_example">

<a name="General_page"></a><h1>General page</h1>
<h4>Tab Size</h4>
<p>The <cite>Tab Size</cite> value specifies the size of each <span class="system">tab stop</span>. These <span class="system">tab stops</span> determine, how much each Tab character will shift the following text.</p>

<h4>Left Margin</h4>
<p>The <cite>Left Margin</cite> value specifies the size of the left <span class="system">selection margin</span>. This <span class="system">selection margin</span> is a space between the text of the document and a border of the main window. Here a user can drag the mouse cursor to quickly select entire lines.</p>

<h4>Text Limit</h4>
<p>The <cite>Text Limit</cite> value specifies the maximum allowed length of text of a document. If this value is to be breached, text may be truncated and a warning will be given. Use this limit in order to create a top limit for your documents. If no such limit is required, leave zero in this field.</p>
<p><b>Versions note:</b> Prior to version <b>4.5.2</b>, this value could be altered any time in order to be able to edit a document of whatever size, but a specific positive value must have always been chosen. Version <b>4.5.2</b> allows to leave this field with zero value for no actual limit.</p>

<h4>Persistent selection in Tools</h4>
<p>The <cite>Persistent selection in Tools</cite> setting specifies whether the selection should outlast all used tools. If checked, the selection will be updated to re-cover the results of any used tool. Otherwise, the selection will be discarded and the caret will be placed at the end of such results (exactly as if the results of that tool were pasted to the document using a clipboard).</p>
<p>Note: For some tools (e.g. <cite>Indent</cite> selection with Tabs or <cite>Quote Mail</cite>) the selection always persits, because these tools are ment to be used several times in sequence on the same selection.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Such a setting may become useful especially, when you need to perform several tools in sequence on the same text. Imagine that you need to use <cite>Unique Lines</cite> tool and then additional <cite>Sort</cite> on the uniqued lines. When this setting is enabled, the selection will automatically cover the results of the first tool, thus you may use the
second tool without need to re-select the text.</p>

<h4>Auto-indent text</h4>
<p>The <cite>Auto-indent text</cite> setting specifies, whether an auto-indentation mode is to be used. When turned on, each time a new line is being started (using the <cite>Enter</cite> key), <cite>Smart Return</cite> feature (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+Enter</cite>) is used instead. The <cite>Smart Return</cite> starts a new line as usual, but also copies all initial <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> from the previous line to the new line to reach the current text indentation. See chapter <a href="#Edit_menu">Edit menu</a> for details.</p>

<h4>Insert Spaces instead of Tab</h4>
<p>The <cite>Insert Spaces instead of Tab</cite> setting specifies, whether to use a Tab character when a <cite>Tab</cite> key is pressed, or whether to insert Spaces instead. The number of Spaces inserted depends on the actual position of the caret on the line and also on the <cite>Tab Size</cite> setting.</p>
<p>Note: While using a fixed-width font, the resulting <i>white space</i> of inserted Spaces should be the same, as if a real Tab was inserted. This, however, does not always work with proportional fonts. In proportional fonts, size of a Space character often differ from a base character width. Therefore, there may be a difference between a real Tab size and a spaced Tab size. This feature is primarily meant for fixed-width fonts only.</p>

<h4>Include underscores within words</h4>
<p>The <cite>Include underscores within words</cite> setting specifies whether an Underscore character should be included within the definition of the <q><a href="#Appendix">word letters</a></q>. This definition is used when working with words, like <cite>Select Word</cite> or <cite>Complete Word</cite> features do.</p>
<p>Note: Other characters, those that are not included within the <q><a href="#Appendix">word letters</a></q> are furthermore divided into two groups: <q><a href="#Appendix">white-spaces</a></q> and <q><a href="#Appendix">word delimiters</a></q>. All word-oriented features of TED Notepad (e.g. <cite>Select Word</cite>) usually treat all white-spaces as one delimiting character. In other words, <cite>Select Word</cite> selects either a word or all consecutive white-spaces or a single word delimiter otherwise.</p>

<h4>Line numbers unwrapped</h4>
<p>The <cite>Line numbers from unwrapped lines</cite> setting specifies whether the lines of a document are to be counted according to the actual word wrapping or not. Turn this setting on to count the lines unwrapped, even while they are being <cite>word wrapped</cite>.</p>
<p>The number of the actual line is displayed in the <cite>Status Bar</cite> and may be used, for example, in the <cite>Go to Line</cite> feature.</p>
<p><b>Warning</b>: Re-calculating of unwrapped lines is not a well-supported operation by the standard Windows edit box. It may noticeably slow down the system performance, when used with longer documents! With a very long document, the application may even stop responding. It may take a long time then to open the <cite>Settings dialog</cite> to turn this setting off. Use this setting with caution.</p>

<h4>Complete Word dialog sorted</h4>
<p>The <cite>Complete Word dialog sorted</cite> setting specifies whether the <cite>Complete Word</cite> dialog items are to be sorted alphabetically, or shown according to their preceding order in the document. See chapter <a href="#Edit_menu">Edit menu</a> for more details about the <cite>Complete Word</cite> feature.</p>

<h4>Exit by Esc</h4>
<p>The <cite>Exit by Esc</cite> setting enables or disables the <cite>Esc</cite> and <cite>Shift+Esc</cite> hotkeys.</p>

<h4>Full path in caption</h4>
<p>The <cite>Full path in caption</cite> setting enables to display the full document path (including drive letter and directory path) in the caption of the main window, instead of the simple document name.</p>

<h4>Recently opened files</h4>
<p>The <cite>Recently opened files</cite> setting specifies whether the <cite>Recent Files</cite> menu is to be active. The <cite>Recently opened files</cite> are always maintained, but they are saved upon <cite>Exit</cite> only when this setting is turned on.</p>
<p>Note: To save <cite>Recent Files</cite> succesfully, no <cite>/ns</cite> command line parameter, nor the <cite>Exit without saving!</cite> may take their place. See chapters <a href="#Command_line_parameters">Command line parameters</a> and <a href="#File_menu">File menu</a>.</p>

<h5>Empty the Recent files menu</h5>
<p>The <cite>Empty</cite> button below the <cite>Recently opened files</cite> empties the list of the <cite>Recently opened files</cite>.</p>

<h4>Fixed-width Font, Proportional Font</h4>
<p>The <cite>Fixed-width Font</cite> specifies whether the default system fixed-width font is to be used as a <cite>fixed-width</cite> font or a custom user's font. Use the <cite>Primary font</cite> button to choose this custom user's font.</p>
<p>The <cite>Proportional Font</cite> specifies whether a default system font is to be used as a <cite>proportional</cite> font or a custom user's font. Use the <cite>Secondary font</cite> button to choose this custom user's font.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<a name="File_page"></a><h1>File page</h1>
<h4>Default encoding</h4>
<p>The <cite>Default encoding</cite> specifies a default file encoding that should be used for new documents. Supported encodings are <span class="system">ANSI</span>, both <span class="system">Unicodes</span> and <span class="system">UTF-8</span>.</p>
<p>Note: See chapter <a href="#Managing_documents">Managing documents</a> for more informations about these file encodings, their usage, advantages and also their pitfalls.</p>

<h4>Default newlines</h4>
<p>The <cite>UNIX/Mac support</cite> specifies, whether the transparent UNIX/Mac <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> conversion support is to be available. See chapter <a href="#Managing_documents">Managing documents</a> for more details about transparent <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> conversions.</p>
<p>The <cite>Windows</cite>, <cite>Unix</cite> and <cite>Mac</cite> fields can be used to specify the default <q><a href="#Appendix">newlines</a></q> to be used for new files.</p>

<h4>Default file type</h4>
<p>The <cite>Default file type</cite> setting specifies, what file extension is to be used by the <cite>Save As</cite> dialog, if no extension is specified explicitly. The default extension may not exceed 4 characters.</p>
<p>The default extension for plain-text documents is usually <var>txt</var>, but users may choose to override this and use another value. E.g. Use <var>html</var>, if you create more HTML documents than simple text files.</p>

<h4>Default path</h4>
<p>The <cite>Default path</cite> defines a relative or absolute path, that is to be used as the starting point in the <cite>Open/Save</cite> dialogs. When an absolute path is specified, it is used unchanged in all cases.</p>
<p>When no path is specified as default path, the current working directory is used, if it contains files, which satisfy the <cite>Filter strings</cite> below. Otherwise, the personal files directory of the current user is used.</p>
<p>When a relative path is specified (e.g. <var>.</var> or <var>\docs</var>), it always refers to the current working directory. Note: The working directory is usually a directory, where TED Notepad is started from. Then this working directory changes with every <cite>Open/Save</cite> dialogs operation.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> A useful example for portable usage is a simple back-slash (<var>\</var>), which will make the <cite>Open/Save</cite> dialogs start in the root directory of the drive, where you launched the application. This can be used to twist your USB drive, when moving TED Notepad on the USB stick drive from one computer to another.</p>

<h4>Filter strings</h4>
<p>The <cite>Filter strings</cite> defines filters,  that are to be used in the <cite>Open/Save</cite> dialogs as file filters. They appear in a combo-box, usually bellow the file name box. Such a filter consists of two <q><a href="#Appendix">strings</a></q> separated by a Pipe character.</p>
<p>The first <q><a href="#Appendix">string</a></q> in a filter is a name to be displayed that describes the filter (e.g. <var>Text Files</var>). The second one specifies the filtering pattern (e.g. <var>*.txt</var>). Therefore a filter for text files would look like this: <var>Text Files|*.txt</var> or maybe even like this: <var>Text Files (*.txt)|*.txt</var>.</p>
<p>To specify multiple filtering patterns for a single filter, use a semicolon to separate the patterns (e.g. <var>*.txt;*.doc;*.bak</var>). A filtering pattern can be a combination of valid filename characters and an asterisk wildcard character. Do not include spaces in the pattern <q><a href="#Appendix">string</a></q>.</p>
<p>Several filters are to be delimited also by a Pipe character. Therefore this <cite>Filter strings</cite> value should eventually consist of pairs of <q><a href="#Appendix">strings</a></q> delimited by Pipes. Each pair defines one filter: a name and its filtering pattern.</p>

<h4>Suggest first line as new file name</h4>
<p>The <cite>Suggest first line as new file name</cite> option specifies, whether the text from the first line of the document is to be suggested in the <cite>Save As</cite> dialog as a new file name instead of the default <var>Untitled</var>. Note: When there is no text on the first line, the <var>Untitled</var> is used regardless of this option.</p>

<h4>Create backup files</h4>
<p>The <cite>Create backup files</cite> option specifies, whether to create backup files by <i>copying</i> the previous version of the original file upon each save operation. The backup file name is created by appending a <var>.~</var> to the original file name.</p>

<h4>Save recovery every 5 mins</h4>
<p>The <cite>Save recovery every 5 mins</cite> option specifies, whether to auto-save the current file every 5 minutes into a recovery file. The recovery file name is created by appending a <var>.$</var> to the original file name. The auto-save operation is performed on background and occurs only, when there are unsaved modifications made to the document.</p>
<p>Note: The recovery file is deleted after a successful <cite>Save</cite> operation; or upon closing the document by a user request (e.g. by opening a new file or closing the editor window).</p>

<h4>Force Read-only files</h4>
<p>The <cite>Force Read-only files</cite> option specifies, whether files with read-only attribute can be written to. By using this option, you override the system default behaviour, which prevents the modification of such files.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You can save a read-only file also by opening its <cite>Properties</cite> dialog (hotkey <cite>Ctrl+J</cite>) and unchecking the read-only attribute. After the saving, you may then choose, whether to set the read-only attribute back.</p>

<h4>Save without BOM</h4>
<p>The <cite>Save without BOM</cite> option specifies, whether to save <span class="system">UTF-8</span> and <span class="system">Unicode</span> files without their Byte-Order-Marks (BOM). <b>Use this setting with caution. Always remember, when you turn it on!</b></p>
<p>Although there might be specific ocasions, where this is useful, it also brings non-trivial complications. A file without a BOM is not recognized correctly by most of the applications. <span class="system">Unicode</span> files may be treated as <span class="system">binary</span> files and in <span class="system">UTF-8</span> files non-ASCII characters may be misinterpreted.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> See also the <cite>Force the default encoding</cite> option below, which can be used to load files without BOM.</p>

<h4>Only one instance of each file</h4>
<p>The <cite>Only one instance of each file</cite> option specifies, whether TED Notepad should check for other instances of the same file already opened. When this option is turned on, each file is cross-checked upon opening, whether it is already opened in another window of TED Notepad. If so, a warning is displayed, asking the user, whether to switch to the already opened window.</p>

<h4>Check if file is modified outside</h4>
<p>The <cite>Check if file is modified outside</cite> option specifies, whether a watch is to be set for every opened file. When this option is turned on, TED Notepad raises a warning every time the current file is modified by some other application. It asks, whether to <cite>Revert</cite> the file upon such event.</p>
<p>By reverting, you discard all unsaved modifications and load the new version of the file. The selection will try to persist the loading, placing the <q><a href="#Appendix">actual insertion point</a></q> to the same location. Also, the actual scrolling should persist unchanged.</p>

<h4>Keep file name on error</h4>
<p>The <cite>Keep file name on error</cite> option specifies, whether the file name should be kept even after an unsuccessful or unclean loading. <b>Use this setting with caution. Always remember, when you turn it on!</b></p>
<p>By default, when a file <i>fails</i> to load (because of a read error, or even when the file is <span class="system">binary</span>), the partially loaded data are displayed with a indication, that the file is already modified. Furthermore, to prevent you from accidentaly saving the modified file back without notice, its file name is discarded. Therefore, you need to explicitly specify a file name to save the data to.</p>
<p>By turning this option on, the above precaution is disabled, allowing you to save the incomplete or modified file right back. Note that when loading binary files, special characters are being modified in the process. The file might then become useless.</p>

<h4>Force the default encoding</h4>
<p>The <cite>Force the default encoding</cite> option specifies, whether to load all files using the default encoding specified above. <b>Use this setting with caution. Always remember, when you turn it on!</b></p>
<p>By turning this option on, all attempts to examine the file encoding are skipped and the default encoding is assumed. Also, all file data is assumed to be part of the text. In result, even an occasional Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) is treated just as a part of the text. This may become useful, when you know the exact encoding of the loaded file, but the file misses the correct BOM.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> See also the <cite>Save without BOM</cite> option above, which can be used to save files without BOM.</p>

<h4>Use multi-level Undo/Redo</h4>
<p><i><a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE clone</a> specific:</i> The <cite>Use multi-level Undo/Redo</cite> turns on/off the multi-level <cite>Undo/Redo</cite> feature. See chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a>.</p>

<h4>Clear Undo buffer upon Save</h4>
<p><i><a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE clone</a> specific:</i> The <cite>Clear Undo buffer upon Save</cite> specifies whether to forget all multi-level actions upon the <cite>Save</cite> operation. The last action remains remembered anyway. This option has no effect when <cite>Use multi-level Undo/Redo</cite> option is turned off. See chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a>.</p>

<h4>Automatic detection of URLs</h4>
<p><i><a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE clone</a> specific:</i> The <cite>Automatic detection of URLs</cite> specifies whether URLs are to be detected and highlighted in the document. Note: It may be necessary to reload somehow the text of the document after applying of the settings/options to get the autodetection fully working. This is because only loaded or somehow modified text is searched for URLs and each apply of the settings/options may discard all previously found links. See chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a>.</p>

<h4>Use doubleclick to launch URLs</h4>
<p><i><a href="#RichEdit_clone">RE clone</a> specific:</i> The <cite>Use doubleclick to launch URLs</cite> specifies whether a doubleclick or a single click on an auto-detected URL is required to launch it in a default internet browser. See chapter <a href="#RichEdit_clone">RichEdit clone</a>.</p>

<hr />

<a name="Settings_page"></a><h1>Settings page</h1>
<p>This page offers a place to specify, which categories of options and settings are to be saved upon every exit, so they outlast to the next time, TED Notepad is started.</p>
<p>If none of these categories is ever saved, TED Notepad will always be running with the default or preset values. If these categories are saved only once, directly after configuring TED Notepad to your specific needs, TED Notepad will always start with such desired configuration. See below.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if these categories are saved upon every exit, TED Notepad always starts the same way it was closed for the last time. This is the default behavior.</p>
<p>Note, that these settings are not shared between two running instances of TED Notepad. Therefore, if you change the <cite>word wrapping</cite> in one window, the other one will remain unchanged. That is usually desired. However, if you add a new <cite>favourite</cite> in one window, it will not be present immediately in the second window. You will have to save the settings of the first window (e.g. by closing it, which will save all the <cite>favourites</cite>). Then you will have to re-open the second window, to reload the settings.</p>
<p>Note: To store the settings more portably, see chapter <a href="#Portable_INI_file">Portable INI file</a>.</p>

<h4>Save settings</h4>
<p>The <cite>Save settings</cite> option specifies whether any options/settings should be saved at all. Saved options/settings are automatically loaded when TED Notepad is runned next time. If this option is not checked, the settings are not saved upon any exit, therefore, they remain the same as they were before.</p>
<p>If you want the settings never to be saved and never to be loaded, uncheck this option the very first time you run TED Notepad and click the <cite>Save checked</cite> button. From now on no other settings will then be saved anymore as well as they have never been before - nothing to load the next time TED Notepad is started.</p>
<p>Note: The technique above will actually save one setting, saying not to save any other settings. To prevent TED Notepad completely from saving any settings, use <cite>/nl</cite> and <cite>/ns</cite> command line parameters. See chapter <a href="#Command_line_parameters">Command line parameters</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to preset the settings once and then have them all the same every time you start TED Notepad, make the changes and then click the <cite>Save checked</cite> button. The settings will be saved. Then uncheck this <cite>Save settings</cite> checkbox and click the <cite>Save checked</cite> button again. From now on no new settings will ever be saved.</p>

<h4>Window position</h4>
<p>The <cite>Window position</cite> specifies whether the main window's position is to be saved. If saved, the next time TED Notepad is started, it will appear on the same position as before. Turning this option on is not recommended much. See notes below for details.</p>
<p><small>Troubleshooting note: If you are using two displays/monitors, you may simply choose to place TED Notepad on the second display. However, when you disconnect one of those displays later and run TED Notepad, its window will be opened on the missing display and will become quite invisible. It may be quite tricky to move it back into viewable area. Therefore, be careful about this setting. A lot of users already get their window lost this way.</small></p>
<p><small class="tnp_blbina">Ludia su proste len ludia! A zensky test funguje stopercentne.. Kazdopadne, s touto featurov vzdy boli (a vzdy budu) nejake nepekne problemy: uzivatelom miznu okna priamo pod rukami.... Kam?&nbsp;;)</small></p>

<h4>Window size</h4>
<p>The <cite>Window size</cite> specifies whether the main window's size is to be saved. If saved, the next time TED Notepad is started, its size will be the same as before. Otherwise, it depends on the system, how big the window will be.</p>

<h4>Basic options</h4>
<p>The <cite>Basic options</cite> category specifies whether basic options from the <a href="#Options_menu">Options menu</a> are to be saved. These are the switches that are usually touched a lot according to specific types of documents and/or the type of usage. Especially, the <cite>Word Wrap</cite> option, the <cite>Status Bar</cite> visibility option, the <cite>Stay on Top</cite> and the <cite>Fixed-width Font</cite> options belong to this category.</p>

<h4>Actual search</h4>
<p>The <cite>Actual search</cite> category specifies whether the searches are to be saved. There are two searches, the primary one with the <cite>Find/Replace</cite> dialogs and the secondary one.</p>
<p>Note: The <cite>Extended Replace</cite> tool is not included within this category, although it is also a searching mechanism.</p>

<h4>Settings</h4>
<p>The <cite>Settings</cite> category specifies whether the settings from the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog are to be saved. These are the settings that are usually not modified a lot.</p>
<p>Note: This category actually archs over the saving of nearly all the settings in the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog. However, note, that <cite>Favourites</cite> and <cite>Filters</cite> are treated as separate categories.</p>

<h4>Filters</h4>
<p>The <cite>Filters</cite> category specifies whether the <cite>Filters</cite> are to be saved. The <cite>Filters</cite> are saved only when they have been modified.</p>

<h4>Tools</h4>
<p>The <cite>Tools</cite> category specifies whether phrases and also some options from the dialogs of tools are to be saved.</p>

<h4>Clipboards</h4>
<p>The <cite>Clipboards</cite> category specifies whether content of the <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite> is to be saved. See chapter <a href="#Clipboards_menu">Clipboards menu</a> for more details about the <cite>Extended Clipboards</cite>.</p>

<a name="RichEdit_clone"></a><h1>RichEdit clone</h1>
<p>There are several differences between standard <span class="system">Light EditBox</span> (<span class="system">LE</span>) and <span class="system">RichEdit</span> (<span class="system">RE</span>) clones of TED Notepad. This table describes only differences affecting their behavior, not their design.</p>

<th width="35%"> LE clone</th>
<th width="35%"> RE clone</th>

<th><cite>Commit Word Wrap</cite> tool.</th>
<td>Fully supported.</td>
<td><span class="system">RichEdit</span> handles the word-wrapping in a very different way than LE does, therefore no <cite>Commit Word Wrap</cite> is available by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><cite>Left selection margin</cite>.</th>

<td>Fully supported.</td>
<td>Tab stops are only supported with <span class="system">RichEdit 3.0</span> and above. Update the <span class="system">RichEdit DLL</span> from the Windows Update site.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Consuming of resources.</th>
<td>LE clone always tries to use the minimum required resources. Generally, it stays on the same level as the original Windows Notepad.</td>
<td>Loading the <span class="system">RichEdit</span> library consumes more resources, what makes TED Notepad (RE) no real notepad replacement. Furthermore, some operations may be a bit slower in this clone, which is the price for its advantages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><cite>Go To Char</cite>, <cite>/c</cite> and <cite>/s</cite> command line parameters.</th>
<td>LE uses <var>CR/LF</var> <q><a href="#Appendix">newline</a></q> sequences, therefore, it takes two characters to pass a line end.</td>
<td>RE does not work with <var>CR/LF</var> <q><a href="#Appendix">newline</a></q> sequences; only <var>LF</var> characters are used. Therefore, passing each line takes only one character in RE, even if the original file contained <var>CR/LF</var> <q><a href="#Appendix">newline</a></q> sequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prefference.</th>
<td colspan="2"> LE clone is the default one. The whole project is oriented to support, develop and test this one.<br /><br />RE clone is being derived directly from LE, to please some Win 98 users, so they can use unlimited file size advantage with TED Notepad. It is done by replacing some general APIs or their arguments upon compilation. Most of the tools/features therefore work the same way, but there are small differences (i.e. <cite>Commit Word Wrap</cite> tool). I am sorry but I have no personal interest to develop special (and often hacking) ways to override these disparities, while <span class="system">RichEdit</span> itself does not help at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Older versions.</th>
<td colspan="2"> Older versions of RE clone are not maintaned and/or supported. The reason, why there is usually no <b>RE Final</b> is, that several older RE clones still contain bugs that were fixed only within next versions. While bugs in specific LE branches are being fixed additionally (to support older/simpler versions even after a newer versions are introduced), this is obviously not the case with the RE clone, mainly because of its lower priority and lower base of its final users (and even testers).
<p>You are always encouraged to use either the LE clone, which is more tested with backward support, or use the latest RE beta, which is usually more <i>stable</i> than any other previous RE version.</td>

<a name="Frequently_Asked_Questions"></a><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div class="tnp_faq">I have turned the <i>save window position and size</i> off, but it still remembers the old position. How can I erase the old position from settings? Is it a bug?</div>
<p>It is not a bug. This behavior allows users to set their window up to the exact place and leave it there forever. Turning the <i>save window position and size</i> option off will not erase any current information about previously saved place. It will not rewrite it if you move the window later. To erase the actual information about saved place, see FAQ about erasing all settings.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="tnp_faq">I have screwed up my settings completely. Is there any chance to repaire them back to normal?</div>
<p>Yes, you can erase all your settings and then adjust them again. To erase all the settings of all previous versions of TED Notepad, follow <a href="http://jsimlo.sk/notepad/files.php/cleanall.reg" class='external text'>this link</a>, download the reg file and run it. Note: This reg file shall clean all settings of all versions of TED Notepad, even your Filters and Favourites! You should back-up them, if you do not want to loose them.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="tnp_faq">I have opened a binary file in TED Notepad and there are some weird black boxes all around. Later I saved the file back, but then it was no longer working. Why?</div>
<p>It is because TED Notepad is not fully binary compatibile. It can safely open binary files, but it has to modify some undisplayable characters after loading. The original file is not damaged upon opening. However, you should not try to save the modified file back.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="tnp_faq">I have placed a huge amount of text into an Extended Clipboard and TED Notepad is refusing to save it into Registry. Why?</div>
<p>TED Notepad always verifies the length of each Extended Clipboard in order to prevent a user from saving a full heavy truck of data into the Registry. Doing so may slow down the system, and it is rarely required. Therefore, TED Notepad shows a warning and truncates long data automatically while saving into the Registry. Note: The content of litigant Extended Clipboard itself will not be truncated.</p>

<div class="tnp_faq">The Open/Save dialogs start in My Documents folder instead of the working folder. Can I fix this? Can I make it work with my USB drive?</div>
<p>The Open/Save dialogs always try to use the path of the currently opened document as the starting place. However, if there is no document opened, there is no path to be used and the dialogs start in the documents location.</p>
<p>You can modify this location by setting a relative or absolute path as the <cite>Default path</cite> in the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog. While the usage of an absolute path is quite obvious, using a relative path may result in confusion. For example, if you use a dot (<var>.</var>) as the <cite>Default path</cite>, then the dialogs will start in the directory, where you started the editor. This may be the location of a text file you double-clicked on in the explorer. Or it may be the working directory of the shortcut you used to launch the application. Other useful example is a simple back-slash (<var>\</var>), which will make the dialogs start in the root of the drive, where you started the application. This can be used to twist your USB drive, when moving from one computer to another.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="tnp_faq">Can I use relative paths in the Favourites menu?</div>
<p>Yes, and it can be very useful, if you use TED Notepad portably and move it on USB from one computer to another. While moving to different computers usually means the drive letter changes a lot, the relative path on the same drive remains the same. Thus you can use a favourite like <var>\doc\example.txt</var> to access your file, if the application was started from the same drive.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly, setting a relative path to favourites is not implemented within TED Notepad yet. You will have to set it manually by modifying the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> file (see <a href="#Portable_INI_file">Portable INI file</a> section for details):</p>

<ol><li>First, add files to Favourites menu. This will add them with absolute paths.</li>
<li>Exit TED Notepad to save settings.
<ul>
<li>Ensure the Favourites are saved into the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> file in a text editor.
<ul>
<li>You can use TED Notepad, but you will have to be careful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find a section named <var>[Favs]</var>.</li>
<li>Update all lines by removing the drive letters and colons (e.g. <var>G:</var>).
<ul>
<li>Note that each back-slash must be written as double-back-slash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save the file, then exit the editor.
<ul>
<li>Important: If you use TED Notepad for editing the <span class="system">TedNPad.ini</span> file, you have to ensure the file is not just overwritten by the old settings upon exit.
<ul>
<li>This can be done by using the Exit without Saving (<cite>Shift+Esc</cite> hotkey).</li>
<li>Or you can move the file temporarily before the exit, then move it back.</li>
<li>Or you can set a read-only attribute to the file temporarily (use <cite>Ctrl+J</cite> hotkey to open a Properties dialog).</li>
<li>Or you can use the <span class="system">/ns</span> command line parameter (see <a href="#Command_line_parameters">Command line parameters</a> for details).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<a name="Appendix"></a><h1>Appendix</h1>
<p>The meaning of some terms used in this manual is as follows below. Many of them are intuitive; some of them may not be well-known; and some of them are used here, only to describe exact actions of some tools within TED Notepad.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li>A <q>white-space</q> is a Space, a Tab or another character that can not be <i>seen</i> but <i>takes place</i> in the document. All other characters, which can be <i>seen</i>, are called <q>graphs</q>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>An <q>alphanum</q><sup>*</sup> is an alpha-numeric character (ie. a, b, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z, 0, 1, ..., 9).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>capital</q><sup>*</sup> is any capital letter (ie. A, B, ..., Z).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Capitals are letters in <q>upper letter case</q> or simply <q>upper case</q> letters and their oposites are called <q>lower case</q> letters and are in <q>lower letter case</q> or simply in <q>lower case</q>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To <q>ignore case</q> is to ignore differences between <q>letter cases</q> like <q>capitals</q> and <q>lower case</q> letters. When <q>ignoring case</q>, letter <var>a</var> is equal to letter <var>A</var>, <var>b</var> equal to <var>B</var>, etc. An antonym of <q>ignore case</q> is to <q>match case</q> and an operation, that <q>matches case</q> is <q>case sensitive</q>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>string</q> is a sequence of characters. Typically, such <q>string</q> is used as a synonym for a phrase, that a user have written in a dialog. (E.g. <cite>Find what</cite> and <cite>Replace with</cite> <q>strings</q> from <cite>Find/Replace</cite> dialogs are always used in find/replace mechanisms.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>word</q> is a non-empty sequence of <q>alphanums</q>. Underscores may be optionally included<sup>**</sup> within words and a phrase <var>hello_world</var> is then also treated as a single <q>word</q> within all Tools and Functions. All characters that such a <q>word</q> can consist of are called <q>word letters</q> or also <q>word characters</q>. Other characters are considered to be <q>word delimiters</q></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>line</q> is a sequence of characters, where two <q>lines</q> are divided by a <var>CR/NL</var> sequence of characters. Note, that if <cite>Word Wrap</cite> is turned on, a <q>line</q> may be wrapped, but within all tools it will be still treated as a single <q>line</q>. Also note, that a single <var>NL</var> or <var>CR</var> character does not divide two <q>lines</q>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>An <q>empty line</q> is a <q>line</q>, that consists only of <q>white-spaces</q>. Therefore a <q>non-empty line</q> is a <q>line</q>, that contains at least one <q>graph</q> character.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>paragraph</q> is a sequence of <q>non-empty lines</q>. Two <q>paragraphs</q> are then divided by a non-empty sequence of <q>empty lines</q>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>sentence</q> is a sequence of characters that begins with a <q>capital</q> and ends with a Dot, a Question mark or an Exclamation mark. Example: <var>Alice? Who the f... is Alice?</var> are two <q>sentences</q>, but <var>Alice? Who the f... Is Alice?</var> are three <q>sentences</q>. Unfortunatelly, even <var>How are you today, Mr. President?</var> are two <q>sentences</q>, which is not very true.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>column</q> is a sequence of characters on a <q>line</q>. Two <q>columns</q> are divided by any of the <q>column delimiters</q>. A <q>column</q> can not exceed a <q>line</q>. Typically, when a <q>line</q> is divided into logical parts by a special <q>delimiter</q> character (e.g. a Tab character), those parts are called <q>columns</q>. <q>Columns</q> are used to cut out a sub-<q>string</q> from a <q>line</q>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <q>char range</q> is a sub-sequence of characters that begins and ends at the specified positions. Char range is used to cut out a sub-<q>string</q> from a longer <q>column</q>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>An <q>actual insertion point</q> (also called a <q>cursor position</q>) is a position of the caret in the documnet or the end of the actual selection, if any. Note, that in special cases, it is the beginning of the selection, if any. These special cases are tools/features that work backward. (e.g. <cite>Find Previous</cite> or <cite>BkSpace Word</cite>.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To <q>unique</q> lines is to remove duplicate lines, to unify them. If lines or words are <q>uniqued</q>, it means that each line (word) is unique and there no two lines are of the same text.</li>
</ul>

<p><small>*: Special characters like &aacute; (a with acute) do not belong to <q>alphanums</q>, nor <q>capitals</q> in English locale settings. To be able to recognize those characters as <q>alphanums</q> and <q>capitals</q> you have to use CTYPE category of the locale that supports it. TED Notepad always works with the system locale settings.</small></p>
